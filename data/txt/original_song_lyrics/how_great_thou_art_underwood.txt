o lord, my god, when i in awesome wonder
consider all the worlds thy hands have made;
i see the stars, i hear the rolling thunder,
thy power throughout the universe displayed
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art, how great thou art.
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art, how great thou art!
and when i think of god, his son not sparing;
sent him to die, i scarce can take it in;
that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
he bled and died to take away my sin.
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art, how great thou art.
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art, how great thou art!
when christ shall come with shout of acclamation
and lead me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
then i shall bow with humble adoration,
and then proclaim, "my god, how great thou art!"
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art, how great thou art.
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art, how great thou art!
