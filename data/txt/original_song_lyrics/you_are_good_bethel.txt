i want to scream it out
from every mountain top
your goodness knows no bounds
your goodness never stops
your mercy follows me
your kindness fills my life
your love amazes me
i sing because you are good
and i dance because you are good
and i shout because you are good
you are good to me to me
nothing and no one comes
anywhere close to you
the earth and oceans deep
only reflect this truth
and in my darkest night
you shine as bright as day
your love amazes me
with a cry of praise my heart will proclaim
you are good you are good
in the sun or rain my life celebrates
you are good you are good
with a cry of praise my heart will proclaim
you are good you are good
in the sun or rain my life celebrates
you are good you are good
