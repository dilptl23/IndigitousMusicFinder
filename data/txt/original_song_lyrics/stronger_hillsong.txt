there is love that came for us
humbled to a sinner's cross
you broke my shame and sinfulness,
you rose again victorious.
faithfulness none can deny
through the storm and through the fire
there is truth that sets me free
jesus christ who lives in me!
you are stronger, you are stronger
sin is broken, you have saved me
it is written, christ is risen!
jesus you are lord of all!
no beginning and no end
you're my hope and my defense
you came to seek and save the lost
you paid it all upon the cross.
so let your name be lifted higher,
be lifted higher, be lifted higherâ€¦
