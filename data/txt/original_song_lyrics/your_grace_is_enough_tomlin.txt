great is your faithfulness oh god
you wrestle with the sinner's heart
you lead us by still waters and to mercy
and nothing can keep us apart
so remember your people
remember your children
remember your promise
oh god
your grace is enough
your grace is enough
your grace is enough for me
great is your love and justice god
you use the weak to lead the strong
you lead us in the song of your salvation
and all your people sing along
so remember your people
remember your children
remember your promise
oh god
your grace is enough
your grace is enough
your grace is enough for me
so remember your people
remember your children
remember your promise
oh god
your grace is enough
your grace is enough
your grace is enough for me
your grace is enough
heaven reaching down to us
your grace is enough for me
god i see your grace is enough
i'm covered in your love
your grace is enough for me
for me
