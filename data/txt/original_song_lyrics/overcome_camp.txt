overcome
jeremy camp

seated above, enthroned in the father's love
destined to die, poured out for all mankind
god's only son, perfect and spotless one
he never sinned but suffered as if he did
all authority
every victory is yours
all authority
every victory is yours
savior, worthy of honor and glory
worthy of all our praise, you overcame
jesus, awesome in power forever
awesome and great is your name, you overcame
power in hand speaking the father's plan

we will overcome by the blood of the lamb
and the word of our testimony, everyone overcome
