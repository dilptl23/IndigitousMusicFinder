he became sin, who knew no sin
that we might become his righteousness
he humbled himself and carried the cross
love so amazing, love so amazing
jesus messiah, name above all names
blessed redeemer, emmanuel
the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven
jesus messiah, lord of all
his body the bread, his blood the wine
broken and poured out all for love
the whole earth trembled, and the veil was torn
love so amazing, love so amazing, yeah
jesus messiah, name above all names
blessed redeemer, emmanuel
the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven
jesus messiah, lord of all
all our hope is in you, all our hope is in you
all the glory to you, god, the light of the world
jesus messiah, name above all names
blessed redeemer, emmanuel
the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven
jesus messiah, lord of all
