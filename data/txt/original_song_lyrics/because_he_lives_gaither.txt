god sent his son, they called him jesus,
he came to love, heal and forgive.
he lived and died to buy my pardon,
an empty grave is there to prove my savior lives.
because he lives
i can face tomorrow
because he lives
all fear is gone
because i know he holds the future
and life is worth the living
just because he lives
how sweet to hold a newborn baby,
and feel the pride and joy he gives,
but greater still the calm assurance:
this child can face uncertain day because he lives.
and then one day i'll cross the river,
i'll fight life's final war with pain.
and then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
i'll see the lights of glory and i'll know he reigns.
