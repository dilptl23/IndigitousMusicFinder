sing to the king who is coming to reign
glory to jesus, the lamb that was slain
life and salvation his empire shall bring
and joy to the nations when jesus is king
come, let us sing a song
a song declaring that we belong to jesus
he is all we need
lift up a heart of praise
sing now with voices raised to jesus
sing to the king
for his returning we watch and we pray
we will be ready the dawn of that day
we'll join in singing with all the redeemed
'cause satan is vanquished and my jesus is king
