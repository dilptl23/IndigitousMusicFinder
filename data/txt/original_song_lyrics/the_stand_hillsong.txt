you stood before creation
eternity within your hands
you spoke all life into motion
my soul now to stand
you stood before my failure
and carried the cross for my shame
my sin weighed upon your shoulders
my soul now to stand
so what can i say
and what could i do
but offer this heart o god
completely to you
so i'll walk upon salvation
your spirit alive in me
this life to declare your promise
my soul now to stand
so what can i say
and what could i do
but offer this heart o god
completely to you
so what can i say
and what could i do
but offer this heart o god
completely to you
so i'll stand
with arms high and heart abandoned
in awe of the one who gave it all
i'll stand
my soul lord to you surrendered
all i am is yours
