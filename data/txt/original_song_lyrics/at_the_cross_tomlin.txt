there's a place where mercy reigns and never dies
there's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide
where all the love i've ever found
comes like a flood
comes flowing down
at the cross
at the cross
i surrender my life
i'm in awe of you
i'm in awe of you
where your love ran red
and my sin washed white
i owe all to you
i owe all to you jesus
there's a place where sin and shame are powerless
where my heart has peace with god and forgiveness
where all the love i've ever found
comes like a flood
comes flowing down
here my hope is found
here on holy ground
here i bow down
here i bow down
here arms open wide
here you save my life
here i bow down
here i bow
