i need you to soften my heart
to break me apart
i need you to open my eyes
to see that you're shaping my life
all i am,
i surrender
give me faith to trust what you say
that you're good and your love is great
i'm broken inside, i give you my life
i need you to soften my heart
to break me apart
i need you pierce through the dark
and cleanse every part of me
give me faith to trust what you say
that you're good and your love is great
i'm broken inside, i give you my life
i may be weak
your spirit strong in me
my flesh may fail
my god you never will
my god you never will
give me faith to trust what you say
that you're good and your love is great
i'm broken inside, i give you my life
give me faith to trust what you say
that you're good and your love is great
i'm broken inside, i give you my life
i may be weak
your spirit strong in me
my flesh may fail
my god you never will
my god you never will
