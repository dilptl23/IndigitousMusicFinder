come, now is the time to worship.
come, now is the time to give your heart.
come, just as you are, to worship.
come, just as you are, before your god.
come.
one day every tongue will confess
you are god.
one day every knee will bow.
still the greatest treasure remains for those
who gladly choose you now.
come, now is the time to worship.
come, now is the time to give your heart.
oh, come. just as you are to worship.
come just as you are before your god.
come.
one day every tongue will confess
you are god.
one day every knee will bow.
still the greatest treasure remains for those
who gladly choose you now.
come, now is the time to worship.
come, now is the time to give your heart.
come, just as you are to worship.
come, just as you are before your god.

oh, come. oh, come. oh, come.
worship the lord. oh, come.
come, come, comeâ€¦
