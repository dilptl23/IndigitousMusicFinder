i'm trading my sorrow
i'm trading my shame
i'm laying them down for the joy of the lord
i'm trading my sickness
i'm trading my pain
i'm laying them down for the joy of the lord
and we say yes lord yes lord yes yes lord
yes lord yes lord yes yes lord
yes lord yes lord yes yes lord amen
i'm pressed but not crushed persecuted not abandoned
struck down but not destroyed
i'm blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure
and his joy's gonna be my strength
though the sorrow may last for the night
his joy comes with the morning
