we stand and lift up our hands
for the joy of the lord is our strength
we bow down and worship him now
how great, how awesome is he
and together we sing
holy is the lord god almighty
the earth is filled with his glory
holy is the lord god almighty
the earth is filled with his glory
the earth is filled with his glory
we stand and lift up our hands
for the joy of the lord is our strength
we bow down and worship him now
how great, how awesome is he
and together we sing
everyone sing
holy is the lord god almighty
the earth is filled with his glory
holy is the lord god almighty
the earth is filled with his glory
the earth is filled with his glory
it's rising up all around
it's the anthem of the lord's renown
repeat
and together we sing,
everyone sing
