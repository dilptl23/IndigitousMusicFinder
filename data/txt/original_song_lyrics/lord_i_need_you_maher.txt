lord, i come, i confess
bowing here i find my rest
without you i fall apart
you're the one that guides my heart
lord, i need you, oh, i need you
every hour i need you
my one defense, my righteousness
oh god, how i need you
where sin runs deep your grace is more
where grace is found is where you are
and where you are, lord, i am free
holiness is christ in me
lord, i need you, oh, i need you
every hour i need you
my one defense, my righteousness
oh god, how i need you
teach my song to rise to you
when temptation comes my way
and when i cannot stand i'll fall on you
jesus, you're my hope and stay
lord, i need you, oh, i need you
every hour i need you
my one defense, my righteousness
oh god, how i need you
you're my one defense, my righteousness
oh god, how i need you
my one defense, my righteousness
oh god, how i need you
