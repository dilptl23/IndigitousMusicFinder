you are my strength when i am weak
you are the treasure that i seek
you are my all in all
seeking you as a precious jewel
lord, to give up i'd be a fool
you are my all in all
jesus, lamb of god
worthy is your name
jesus, lamb of god
worthy is your name
oh, your name is worthy
taking my sin, my cross, my shame
rising again i bless your name
(i bless your name)
you are my all in all
(oh yes you are, yes you are)
when i fall down you pick me up
when i am dry you fill my cup
(you fill my cup)
you are my all in all
(my all, lord, hallelujah)
jesus, lamb of god
worthy is your name
(oh, your name, your precious name is worthy, lord)
jesus, lamb of god
worthy is your name
you're my everything
the beginning and the end
the first, the last you are
the great i am
jesus, lamb of god
worthy is your name
jesus, lamb of god
(oh, my jesus, my precious jesus)
worthy is your name
worthy is your name
worthy is your name
