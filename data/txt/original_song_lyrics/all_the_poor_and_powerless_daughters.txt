all the poor and powerless
and all the lost and lonely
all the thieves will come confess
and know that you are holy
will know that you are holy
and all will sing out
hallelujah
and we will cry out
hallelujah
and all the hearts that are content
and all who feel unworthy
and all who hurt with nothing left
will know that you are holy
and all will sing out
hallelujah
and we will cry out
hallelujah
shout it
go on and scream it from the mountains
go on and tell it to the masses
that he is god
we will sing out
hallelujah
and we will cry out
hallelujah
we will sing out
hallelujah
shout it
go on and scream it from the mountains
go on and tell it to the masses
that he is god
