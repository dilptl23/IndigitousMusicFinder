Song For Another Time
Old Dominion

Right now we both know
We're Marina del Rey,
Plane's gonna fly away
And you'll be on it
And by this time tomorrow
I'll be singing yesterday
The sunshine's gonna fade
And we can't stop it
So before we turn in, I can't make you love me

Let's be Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline,
Free Fallin', Small Town Saturday Night.
Before we lose that Loving Feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream,
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry,
But that's a song for another time

Well just for one more day
What do you say
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday morning's coming down
And let's take a drive you and I down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those pink houses
Yeah we might be a Candle in the Wind
But let's pretend we're

Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline,
Free Fallin', Small Town Saturday Night.
Before we lose that Loving Feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream,
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon you'll be always on my mind,
But that's a song for another time

So before we're singing I will always love you

Let's sing Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline,
Free Fallin', Small Town Saturday Night.
Before we lose that Loving Feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream,
Paradise City where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry,
But that's a song for another time

Yeah, that's a song for another time
(Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline)
Hey that's a song for another time
(Free Fallin', Small Time Saturday Night)
That's a song for another time
