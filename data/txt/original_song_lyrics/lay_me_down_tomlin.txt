with this heart open wide
from the depths from the heights
i will bring a sacrifice
with these hands lifted high
here my song here my cry
i will bring a sacrifice
i will bring a sacrifice
i lay me down
i'm not my own
i belong to you alone
lay me down
lay me down
oh, hand on my heart
this much is true
there's no life apart from you
lay me down
lay me down
letting go of my pride
giving up all my rights
take this life and let it shine, shine, shine
take this life and let it shine
i lay me down
i'm not my own
i belong to you alone
lay me down
lay me down, oh oh oh
hand on my heart
this much is true
there's no life apart from you
lay me down
lay me down
oh oh oh
lay me down
lay me down
it will be my joy to say
your will, your way
it will be my joy to say
your will, your way
it will be my joy to say
your will, your way, always
it will be my joy to say
your will, your way
it will be my joy to say
your will, your way
it will be my joy to say
your will, your way, always
i lay me down
i'm not my own
i belong to you alone
lay me down
lay me down, oh oh oh
hand on my heart
this much is true
there's no life apart from you
lay me down
lay me down, oh oh oh
lay me down
lay me down, oh oh oh
lay me down
lay me down
