at your name
the mountains shake and crumble
at your name
the oceans roar and tumble
at your name
angels will bow
the earth will rejoice
your people cry out
lord of all the earth
we shout your name, shout your name
filling up the skies
with endless praise, endless praise
yahweh, yahweh
we love to shout your name, oh lord
at your name
the morning breaks in glory
at your name
creation sings your story
at your name
angels will bow
the earth will rejoice
your people cry out
lord of all the earth
we shout your name, shout your name
filling up the skies
with endless praise, endless praise
yahweh, yahweh
we love to shout your name, oh lord
there is no one like our god
we will praise you, praise you
there is no one like our god
we will sing, we will sing
lord of all the earth
we shout your name, shout your name
filling up the skies
with endless praise, endless praise
yahweh, yahweh
we love to shout your name, oh lord
lord of all the earth
we shout your name, shout your name
filling up the skies
with endless praise, endless praise
yahweh, yahweh
we love to shout your name, oh lord
