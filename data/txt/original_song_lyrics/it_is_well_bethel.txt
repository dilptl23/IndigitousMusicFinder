grander earth has quaked before
moved by the sound of his voice
seas that are shaken and stirred
can be calmed and broken for my regard
chorus
and through it all, through it all
my eyes are on you
and through it all, through it all
it is well
and through it all, through it all
my eyes are on you
it is well with me
far be it from me to not believe
even when my eyes can't see
and this mountain that's in front of me
will be thrown into the midst of the sea
through it all, through it all
my eyes are on you
through it all, through it all
it is well
it is well
so let go my soul and trust in him
the waves and wind still know his name 
it is well with my soul
it is well with my soul
it is well with my soul
it is well with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul
through it all, through it all
my eyes are on you
through it all, through it all
it is well with me.
