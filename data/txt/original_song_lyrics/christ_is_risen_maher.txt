let no one caught in sin remain*
inside the lie of inward shame
we fix our eyes upon the cross
and run to him who showed great love
and bled for us
freely you bled, for us
christ is risen from the dead
trampling over death by death
come awake, come awake!
come and rise up from the grave!
christ is risen from the dead
we are one with him again
come awake, come awake!
come and rise up from the grave!
beneath the weight of all our sin
you bow to none but heavens will
no scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
no burden great can hold you down
in strength you reign
forever let your church proclaim
christ is risen from the dead
trampling over death by death
come awake, come awake!
come and rise up from the grave
christ is risen from the dead
we are one with him again
come awake, come awake!
come and rise up from the grave
oh death! where is your sting?
oh hell! where is your victory?
oh church! come stand in the light!
the glory of god has defeated the night!
oh death! where is your sting?
oh hell! where is your victory?
oh church! come stand in the light!
our god is not dead, he's alive! he's alive!
christ is risen from the dead
trampling over death by death
come awake, come awake!
come and rise up from the grave
christ is risen from the dead
we are one with him again
come awake, come awake!
come and rise up from the grave
rise up from the graveâ€¦
