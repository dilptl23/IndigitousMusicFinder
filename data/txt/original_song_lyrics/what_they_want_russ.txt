What They Want
Russ

They let us in the rap game
I swear they let me in the motherfucking rap game

Got a chick I call her Lola
She feel like the ocean
Likes to drink and smoke some doja
And i feel like smokin
Plus she good at charmin cobras
I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one no
Got a chick I call her Catia
She be actin bougie
The she came through and topped me off
Now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the mafia
Her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones no

What they want what they want what they want
Dollar signs
Yea I know its what they want
What they want what they want what they want
Yall ain't foolin me at all

I been at this shit for 9 years
Now they startin to call
I'm a DIY pioneer
They tryna get involved
Yippee Kiyay Ahh Yea
Bout to set it off
I'm probably the only one yea
Come correct when you approach me
I can size you up
Takin all the shots like Kobe
Almost 81
Guess I gotta play the goalie
And go and save me somethin
Im proabably the only one yea

What they want what they want what they want
Dollar signs
Yea i know its what they want
What they want what they want what they want
Yall ain't foolin me at all

Who wants my money I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Whos pullin strings I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck they be talkin like I'm the dumbest but I know
What they want from me
Dollars lotta stock in me
It ain't nothin personal
Its business and I'm a commodity
But honestly
Pop Pop would be turnin in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss in me
I'll be damned

What they want what they want what they want
Dollar signs
Yea I know its what they want
What they want what they want what they want
Yall ain't foolin me at all
