this is the air i breathe
this is the air i breathe
your holy presence
living in me
this is the air i breathe
this is the air i breathe
your holy presence
living in me
and i, i'm desperate for you
and i, i'm lost without you
oh, i'm lost without you
i'm lost without you
you are my daily bread
this is my daily bread
this is my daily bread
your very word
spoken to me
oh
this is my daily bread
oh, you are
this is my daily bread
your very word
spoken to me
and i, i'm desperate for you
and i, i'm lost without you
oh, i'm lost without you
and i, i'm desperate for you
and i, i'm lost without you
oh, i'm lost without you
i'm lost without you
i'm nothing without you
