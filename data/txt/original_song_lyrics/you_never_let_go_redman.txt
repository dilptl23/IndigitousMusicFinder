even though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
your perfect love is casting out fear
and even when i'm caught in the middle
of the storms of this life
i won't turn back, i know you are near
and i will fear no evil
for my god is with me
and if my god is with me
whom then shall i fear?
whom then shall i fear?
oh no, you never let go
through the calm and through the storm
oh no, you never let go
in every high and every low
oh no, you never let go
lord, you never let go of me
and i can see a light that is coming
for the heart that holds on
a glorious light beyond all compare
and there will be an end to these troubles
but until that day comes
we'll live to know you here on the earth
oh no, you never let go
through the calm and through the storm
oh no, you never let go
in every high and every low
oh no, you never let go
lord, you never let go of me
yes, i can see a light that is coming
for the heart that holds on
and there will be an end to these troubles
but until that day comes
still i will praise you, still i will praise you
oh no, you never let go
through the calm and through the storm
oh no, you never let go
in every high and every low
oh no, you never let go
lord, you never let go of me
oh no, you never let go
through the calm and through the storm
oh no, you never let go
in every high and every low
oh no, you never let go
lord, you never let go of me
