i stand before you now
the greatness of your renown
i have heard of the majesty and wonder of you
king of heaven, in humility, i bow
as your love, in wave after wave
crashes over me, crashes over me
for you are for us
you are not against us
champion of heaven
you made a way for all to enter in
i have heard you calling my name
i have heard the song of love that you sing
so i will let you draw me out beyond the shore
into your grace
your grace
you make me brave
you make me brave
you call me out beyond the shore into the waves
you make me brave
you make me brave
no fear can hinder now the love that made a way
you make me brave
you make me brave
you call me out beyond the shore into the waves
you make me brave
you make me brave
no fear can hinder now the promises you made
as your love, in wave after wave
crashes over me, crashes over me
for you are for us
you are not against us
champion of heaven
you made a way for all to enter in
