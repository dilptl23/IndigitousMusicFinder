this is my desire to honor you
lord, with all my heart, i worship you
all i have within me, i give you praise
all that i adore is in you
lord, i give you my heart
i give you my soul, i live for you alone
every breath that i take, every moment i'm awake
lord, have your way in me
this is my desire to honor you
lord, with all my heart, i worship you

i give you my soul, i live for you alone
every breath that i take, every moment i'm awake
lord, have your way in me
and i will live
and i will live for you
and i will live
and i will live for you
oh and i will live
and i will live
and i will live for you
lord, i give you my heart
i give you my soul, i live for you alone
every breath that i take, every moment i'm awake
lord, have your way in me
