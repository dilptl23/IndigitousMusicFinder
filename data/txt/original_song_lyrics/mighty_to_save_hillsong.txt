everyone needs compassion
a love that's never ending
let mercy fall on me
everyone needs forgiveness
the kindness of a savior
the hope of nations
saviour he can move the mountains
my god is mighty to save
he is mighty to save
forever author of salvation
he rose and conquered the grave
jesus conquered the grave
so take me as you find me
all my fears and failures
fill my life again
i give my life to follow
everything i believe in
now i surrender
saviour he can move the mountains
my god is mighty to save
he is mighty to save
forever author of salvation
he rose and conquered the grave
jesus conquered the grave
saviour he can move the mountains
my god is mighty to save
he is mighty to save
forever author of salvation
he rose and conquered the grave
jesus conquered the grave
shine your light and let the whole world see
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
saviour he can move the mountains
my god is mighty to save
he is mighty to save
forever author of salvation
he rose and conquered the grave
jesus conquered the grave
saviour he can move the mountains
my god is mighty to save
he is mighty to save
forever author of salvation
he rose and conquered the grave
jesus conquered the grave
shine you light and let the whole world see
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
were singing for the glory of the risen king jesus
