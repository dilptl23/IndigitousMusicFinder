he is jealous for me,
loves like a hurricane, i am a tree,
bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
when all of a sudden,
i am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
and i realize just how beautiful you are,
and how great your affections are for me.
and, oh, how he loves us, oh,
oh, how he loves us,
how he loves us all
he is jealous for me,
love's like a hurricane, i am a tree,

and, oh, how he loves us, oh,
oh, how he loves us,
how he loves us all
yeah, he loves us,
oh, how he loves us,
oh, how he loves us,
oh, how he loves.
and we are his portion and he is our prize,
drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes,
if his grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.
and heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
and my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
i don't have time to maintain these regrets,
when i think about the way...
that he loves us,
oh, how he loves us,
oh, how he loves us,
oh, how he loves.
yeah, he loves us,
oh, how he loves us,
oh, how he loves us,
oh, how he loves.
yeah, he loves us,
oh, how he loves us...
oh, how he loves us...
oh, how he loves us.
