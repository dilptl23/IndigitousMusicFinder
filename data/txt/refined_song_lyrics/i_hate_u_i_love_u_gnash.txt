Feeling used.
But I'm.
Still missing you.
And I can't.

Just wanna feel your kiss.
Against my lips.
And now all this time.
Is passing by.

It hurts me every time I see you.
Realize how much I need you.


I hate you, I love you,.
I hate that I love you.
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you.
I hate you, I love you,.

You want her, you need her.
And I'll never be her.


I miss you when I can't sleep.
Or right after coffee.
Or right when I can't eat.
I miss you in my front seat.

From nights we don't remember.
Do you miss me like I miss you?.
Fucked around and got attached to you.
Friends can break your heart too,.

If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit.
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit.
I type a text but then I never mind that shit.
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit.

You're still in love with me but your friends don't know.
If you wanted me you would just say so.
And if I were you, I would never let me go.


I hate you, I love you,.
I hate that I love you.
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you.
I hate you, I love you,.

You want her, you need her.
And I'll never be her.


I don't mean no harm.
I just miss you on my arm.
Wedding bells were just alarms.
Caution tape around my heart.

You said you wouldn't and you fucking did.
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix.
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed.
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing.

I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing.
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings.
When love and trust are gone.
I guess this is moving on.

So every lonely night I sing this song.


I hate you, I love you,.
I hate that I love you.
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you.
I hate you, I love you,.

You want her, you need her.
And I'll never be her.


All alone I watch you watch her.
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen.
You don't care you never did.
You don't give a damn about me.

She is the only thing you ever see.
How is it you never notice.
That you are slowly killing me.


I hate you, I love you,.
I hate that I love you.
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you.
I hate you, I love you.
