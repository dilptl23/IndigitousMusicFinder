god sent his son, they called him jesus,.
he came to love, heal and forgive..
he lived and died to buy my pardon,.
an empty grave is there to prove my savior lives..

i can face tomorrow.
because he lives.
all fear is gone.
because i know he holds the future.

just because he lives.
how sweet to hold a newborn baby,.
and feel the pride and joy he gives,.
but greater still the calm assurance:.
