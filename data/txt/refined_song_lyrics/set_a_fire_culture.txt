(set a fire down in my soul.
that i can't contain.
that i can't control.
i want more of you, god.

no place i would rather be.
no place i would rather be.
no place i would rather be.
than here in your love, here in your love.

that i can't contain, that i can't control.
i want more of you, god.
i want more of you, god.
i want more.

i want more.
i want more.
i want more.
i want more of you.

set a fire down in my soul.
that i can't contain, that i can't control.
i want more of you, god.
i want more of you, god.

no place i would rather be.
no place i would rather be.
than here in your love, here in your love.
set a fire down in my soul.

i want more of you, god.
i want more of you, god.
i want more.
i want more.

i want more.
i want more.
i want more of you.
pour it out.
