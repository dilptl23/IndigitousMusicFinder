Girl I've never seen you in this town.
If you need somebody to show you around, well.
I know somebody.
It's a little too loud to talk in here.

I know a place and I know somebody.

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside.
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride.
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky.
Yeah, I know a guy.

That can love you like a song on the radio dial.
If that's what you want tonight.
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes.
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),.


I'm lovin' the way you act so shy.
Like you ain't sure, like you can't decide.
But I heard you tell your friends that you know somebody.
That makes you laugh, that can get you home.

So come on, you know I'm that somebody.

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside.
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride.
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky.
Yeah, I know a guy.

That can love you like a song on the radio dial.
If that's what you want tonight.
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes.
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),.


That's lookin' for a girl like you.
Could fall in a kiss or two.
Baby tell me what you wanna do.
Cause I know.

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside.
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride.
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky.
Yeah, I know a guy.

That can love you like a song on the radio dial.
If that's what you want tonight.
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes.
I know somebody, I know somebody.
