Sha la la la-- la la la.
Oh baby.
Sha la la la-- la la la.
Oh baby.

Oh baby.
That I know you don't know what I've been going through.
Oh baby.
'Cause you make me happy baby, so I can say.

Sha la la la-- la la la.
I love you.
Sha la la la-- la la la.
Thinkin' of you.

Oh baby.
And I've been feeling this way for such a long time.
Ya, baby.
Aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy, I want to say.

I'm trying, this feeling just won't die.
Oh.
Sha la la la-- la la la.
Make you cry.

Baby.
And once I see you I can't leave your love alone.
Ya, heh, baby.
Aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy baby, let me sing.

Sha la la la-- la la la.
Oh baby.
Sha la la la-- la la la.
Oh baby....
