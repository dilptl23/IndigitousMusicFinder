who breaks the power of sin and darkness.
whose love is mighty and so much stronger.
the king of glory, the king above all kings.
who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder.

the king of glory, the king above all kings.
this is amazing grace.
this is unfailing love.
that you would take my place.

you lay down your life.
that i would be set free.
oh, jesus, i sing for.
all that you've done for me.

who makes the orphan a son and daughter.
the king of glory, the king of glory.
who rules the nations with truth and justice.
shines like the sun in all of its brilliance.

this is amazing grace.
this is unfailing love.
that you would take my place.
that you would bear my cross.

that i would be set free.
oh, jesus, i sing for.
all that you've done for me.
worthy is the lamb who was slain.

worthy is the lamb who was slain.
worthy is the king who conquered the grave.
worthy is the lamb who was slain.
worthy is the king who conquered the grave.

worthy, worthy, worthy.
oh.
this is amazing grace.
this is unfailing love.

that you would bear my cross.
you lay down your life.
that i would be set free.
oh, jesus, i sing for.
