I used to believe.
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful.
Somethin' beautiful.
Sellin' a dream.

On a miracle.


Say, go through the darkest of days.
Heaven's a heartbreak away.
Never let you go, never let me down.
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride.

Never let you go, never let me down.


Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah.
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah.
Let me love you.
Let me love you.

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah.
Let me love you.
Let me love you.
Oh, baby, baby.


Don't fall asleep.
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us.
Miles ahead of us.
All that we need.

Know we're good enough.


Say go through the darkest of days.
Heaven's a heartbreak away.
Never let you go, never let me down.
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride.

Never let you go, never let me down.


Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah.
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah.
Let me love you.
Let me love you.

I won't give up, nah-nah-nah.
Let me love you.
Let me love you.
Oh, baby, baby.


Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah.
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah.
Let me love you.
Let me love you.
