there's nothing worth more.
that could ever come close.
no thing can compare.
you're our living hope.

i've tasted and seen.
of the sweetest of loves.
where my heart becomes free.
and my shame is undone.

holy spirit, you are welcome here.
come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
your glory, god, is what our hearts long for.
to be overcome by your presence, lord.
