oh, i've heard a thousand stories.
of what they think you're like.
but i've heard the tender whisper.
of love in the dead of night.

and that i'm never alone.
you're a good good father.
it's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are.
and i'm loved by you.

oh, and i've seen many searching.
for answers far and wide.
but i know we're all searching.
for answers only you provide.

before we say a word.
you're a good good father.
it's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are.
and i'm loved by you.

cause you are perfect in all of your ways.
you are perfect in all of your ways.
you are perfect in all of your ways to us.
you are perfect in all of your ways.

you are perfect in all of your ways to us.
oh, it's love so undeniable.
i, i can hardly speak.
peace so unexplainable.

as you call me deeper still.
as you call me deeper still.
as you call me deeper still.
into love, love, love.

it's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are.
and i'm loved by you.
it's who i am, it's who i am, it's who i am.
cause you are perfect in all of your ways.

you are perfect in all of your ways to us.
you're a good good father.
you are perfect in all of your ways.
you are perfect in all of your ways.
