my hope is built on nothing less.
than jesus blood and righteousness.
i dare not trust the sweetest frame.
but wholly trust in jesus name.

than jesus blood and righteousness.
i dare not trust the sweetest frame.
but wholly trust in jesus name.
christ alone; cornerstone.

through the storm, he is lord.
lord of all.
when darkness seems to hide his face.
i rest on his unchanging grace.

my anchor holds within the veil.

christ alone; cornerstone.
weak made strong; in the saviour's love.

when he shall come with trumpet sound,.
oh, may i then in him be found;.
dressed in his righteousness alone,.
