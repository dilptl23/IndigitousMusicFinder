All eyes on ya.
Ask you how your week been.
Workin' always, let me.
Work you out for the weekend.

Can you tame me?.
I'm gon' let it out.
Let you down.

Let's get to it.
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before.
Take you to places you never been before.
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside.

Horse and carriage, señorita.
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza.
Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach.
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'm a bite into your peach.

And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep.
And um, I must look amazing with you.
Cause every time you on my arm I got.

All eyes on me.
I need your attention.
Put your body on me.
You the one I'm missin'.

I don't want your love.
We ain't gotta fake it.
We both tryna fuck.

'Member when you used to curved me, leave my text message unread?.
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed.
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'.
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy.

I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy.
I remember when your money was young.
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's.
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners.

Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh.
We in the Chanel store and.

All eyes on me.
I need your attention.
Put your body on me.
You the one I'm missin'.

I don't want your love.
We ain't gotta fake it.
We both tryna fuck.
All eyes on you.

Lookin' at me like you love me.
We can do it now or later.
She wan' lick on party favorite.
On my wave, tryna surf it up.

Certified with the double-M pullin' up.
Tooly got a room, we'll play "Room Up In Here", been here.
Girl, you know my intentions.
I put you on the wall like a picture.

Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'.
All the lights low, but we lit up.
I don't let you down if I get up.
Like you got a man, but you're fed up.


You want me to say your name, huh?.
Karrueche!.

All eyes on me.
I need your attention.
Put your body on me.
You the one I'm missin'.

I don't want your love.
We ain't gotta fake it.
We both tryna fuck.
