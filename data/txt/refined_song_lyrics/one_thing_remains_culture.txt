stronger than the power of the grave.
constant through the trial and the change.
one thing remains.
your love never fails it never gives up it never runs out on me.

on and on and on and on it goes.
for it overwhelms and satisfies my soul.
and i never ever have to be afraid.
one thing remains.

your love.
in death and in life i'm confident and covered by the power of your great love.
my debt is paid there's nothing that can separate my heart from your great love.
your love never fails it never gives up it never runs out on me.

for it overwhelms and satisfies my soul.
and i never ever have to be afraid.
one thing remains.
your love goes on.

because.
on and on and on and on it goes.
for it overwhelms and satisfies my soul.
and i never ever have to be afraid.
