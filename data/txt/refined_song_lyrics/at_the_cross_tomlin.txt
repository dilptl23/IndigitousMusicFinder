there's a place where mercy reigns and never dies.
there's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide.
where all the love i've ever found.
comes like a flood.

at the cross.
at the cross.
i surrender my life.
i'm in awe of you.

where your love ran red.
and my sin washed white.
i owe all to you.
i owe all to you jesus.

where my heart has peace with god and forgiveness.
where all the love i've ever found.
comes like a flood.
comes flowing down.

here on holy ground.
here i bow down.
here i bow down.
here arms open wide.
