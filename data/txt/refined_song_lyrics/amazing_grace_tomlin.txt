amazing grace.
how sweet the sound.
that saved a wretch like me.
i once was lost, but now i'm found.

'twas grace that taught my heart to fear.
and grace my fears relieved.
how precious did that grace appear.
the hour i first believed.

i've been set free.
my god, my savior has ransomed me.
and like a flood his mercy reigns.
unending love, amazing grace.

his word my hope secures.
he will my shield and portion be.
as long as life endures.
my chains are gone.

my god, my savior has ransomed me.
and like a flood his mercy reigns.
unending love, amazing grace.
the earth shall soon dissolve like snow.
