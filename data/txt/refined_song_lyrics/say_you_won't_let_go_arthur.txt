I met you in the dark.
You lit me up.
You made me feel as though.
I was enough.

We drank too much.
I held your hair back when.
You were throwing up.

Then you smiled over your shoulder.
For a minute I was stone cold sober.
I pulled you closer to my chest.
And you asked me to stay over.

I think that you should get some rest.

I knew I loved you then.
But you'd never know.
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go.
I knew I needed you.

But I wanna stay with you.
Until we're grey and old.
Just say you won't let go.
Just say you won't let go.

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed.
I'll bring you coffee.
With a kiss on your head.
And I'll take the kids to school.

And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night.

When you looked over your shoulder.
For a minute, I forget that I'm older.
I wanna dance with you right now, oh.
And you look as beautiful as ever.

You make me feel this way somehow.

I'm so in love with you.
And I hope you know.
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold.
We've come so far my dear.

And I wanna stay with you.
Until we're grey and old.
Just say you won't let go.
Just say you won't let go.

I wanna live with you.
Even when we're ghosts.
'Cause you were always there for me.
When I needed you most.

I'm gonna love you 'til.
My lungs give out.
I promise till death we part.
Like in our vows.

Now everybody knows.
That it's just you and me.
Until we're grey and old.
Just say you won't let go.
