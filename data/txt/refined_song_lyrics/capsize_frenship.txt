Up at night I'm awake cause it haunts me.
That I never got to say what I wanted.
Oh my God, oh my God.
I’m not the same as I was with you.

Oh my God, oh my God.

How could you have ever known.
If I never let it show, now I just wanna know are you?.

I'm fine.
Drop tears in the morning.
Give in to the lonely.
Here it comes with no warning.

Too close to the bottom.
I'm right back where I started.
Said I'm fine.

Your silhouette is burned in my memory.
Rubble left from the moment that you left me.
Oh my God, oh my God.
And three words have never come easy.

Oh my God, oh my God.

How could you have ever known.
If I never let it show, now I just wanna know are you?.

I'm fine.
Drop tears in the morning.
Give in to the lonely.
Here it comes with no warning.

Too close to the bottom.
I'm right back where I started.
Said I'm fine.

I'm swimming up against the tide.
Oh my god.
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired.
Oh my god.

Oh my god.
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired.
Oh my god.

I'm fine.
Drop tears in the morning.
Give in to the lonely.
Here it comes with no warning.

Too close to the bottom.
I'm right back where I started.
Said I'm fine.
