you unravel me with a melody.
you surround me with a song.
of deliverance from my enemies.
'til all my fears are gone.

i am a child of god.
from my mother's womb.
you have chosen me.
love has called my name.

into your family.
your blood flows through my veins.
i'm no longer a slave to fear.
i am a child of god.

by the arms of the father.
i am surrounded.
by songs of deliverance.
we've been liberated.

we're the sons and the daughters.
let us sing our freedom.
you split the sea.
so i could walk right through it.

you rescued me.
and i could stand and sing.
i am a child of god....
you split the sea.

you drowned my fears in perfect love.
you rescued me.
and i will stand and sing.
i am a child of god.

i am a child of god.
i am a child of god.
yes, i am.
i am a child of god.
