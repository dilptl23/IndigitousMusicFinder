in christ alone my hope is found,.
he is my light, my strength, my song;.
this cornerstone, this solid ground,.
firm through the fiercest drought and storm..

when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!.
my comforter, my all in all,.
here in the love of christ i stand..
in christ alone! who took on flesh.

this gift of love and righteousness.
scorned by the ones he came to save:.
till on that cross as jesus died,.
the wrath of god was satisfied -.

here in the death of christ i live..
there in the ground his body lay.
light of the world by darkness slain:.
then bursting forth in glorious day.

and as he stands in victory.
sin's curse has lost its grip on me,.
for i am his and he is mine -.
bought with the precious blood of christ..

this is the power of christ in me;.
from life's first cry to final breath..
jesus commands my destiny..
no power of hell, no scheme of man,.
