you stood before creation.
eternity within your hands.
you spoke all life into motion.
my soul now to stand.

and carried the cross for my shame.
my sin weighed upon your shoulders.
my soul now to stand.
so what can i say.

but offer this heart o god.
completely to you.
so i'll walk upon salvation.
your spirit alive in me.

my soul now to stand.
so what can i say.
and what could i do.
but offer this heart o god.

so what can i say.
and what could i do.
but offer this heart o god.
completely to you.

with arms high and heart abandoned.
in awe of the one who gave it all.
i'll stand.
my soul lord to you surrendered.
