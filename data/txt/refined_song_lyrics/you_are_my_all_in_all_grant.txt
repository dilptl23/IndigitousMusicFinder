you are my strength when i am weak.
you are the treasure that i seek.
you are my all in all.
seeking you as a precious jewel.

you are my all in all.
jesus, lamb of god.
worthy is your name.
jesus, lamb of god.

oh, your name is worthy.
taking my sin, my cross, my shame.
rising again i bless your name.
(i bless your name).

(oh yes you are, yes you are).
when i fall down you pick me up.
when i am dry you fill my cup.
(you fill my cup).

(my all, lord, hallelujah).
jesus, lamb of god.
worthy is your name.
(oh, your name, your precious name is worthy, lord).

worthy is your name.
you're my everything.
the beginning and the end.
the first, the last you are.

jesus, lamb of god.
worthy is your name.
jesus, lamb of god.
(oh, my jesus, my precious jesus).
