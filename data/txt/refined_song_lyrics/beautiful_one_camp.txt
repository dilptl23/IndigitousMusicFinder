wonderful, so wonderful.
is your unfailing love.
your cross has spoken mercy over me.
no eye has seen no ear has heard.

how glorious, how beautiful you are..
beautiful one i love you.
beautiful one i adore.
beautiful one my soul must sing..

your glory fills the skies.
your mighty works displayed for all to see.
the beauty of your majesty.
awakes my heart to see.

beautiful one i love you.
beautiful one i adore.
beautiful one my soul must sing..
beautiful one i love you.

beautiful one my soul must sing..
you opened my eyes to your wonders anew.
you captured my heart with this love.
because nothing on earth is as beautiful as you.

you captured my heart with this love.
because nothing on earth is as beautiful as you are..

beautiful one i adore.

beautiful one i love you.
