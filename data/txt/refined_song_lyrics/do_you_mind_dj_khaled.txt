Yo, he ain't messing with no average chick, pop, pop.
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot.
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks.
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron/Iguodal blocks.

Hitting them home runs, I'll be like "go Mets!".
I want a dude that'll still kiss me when he mad.
Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags.

No need to hesitate, I need a new patient.

Come on let me taste it until I get in love.
Hope you're ready cause I'm a beat it up.
Do you mind when I'm a had it? Know how to heat it up.

I should, I should be the one, baby you gon' learn that.

I'm a do that favor, drippin' flavor in the two piece.
I'm gonna keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie.

Still in the trap but I like my bitches bougie.
Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me little mama.
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover.
You want watches, new Versaces, you want Céline.


Seeing two G-wagons in my driveway.
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace.
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down.
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now.

First time your friends really got to see Balmain.
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes.
We the best and I told you this back in '05.
