I won't lie to you.
I know he's just not right for you.
And you can tell me if I'm off.
But I see it on your face.

And you're spending all your time.
In this wrong situation.
And anytime you want it to stop.


I know I can treat you better than he can.
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman.
Tell me why are we wasting time.
On all your wasted crying.

I know I can treat you better.
Better than he can.


I'll stop time for you.
The second you say you'd like me to.
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing.
Baby, just to wake up with you.

Tell me what you want to do.


'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can.
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman.
Tell me why are we wasting time.
On all your wasted crying.

I know I can treat you better.
Better than he can.


Better than he can.


Give me a sign.
Take my hand, we'll be fine.
Promise I won't let you down.
Just know that you don't.

Promise I'll never let you down.


'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can.
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman.
Tell me why are we wasting time.
On all your wasted crying.

I know I can treat you better.
Better than he can.
