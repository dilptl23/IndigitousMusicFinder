She just wants to be beautiful.
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits.
She craves attention, she praises an image.
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor.

Deeper than the eyes can find it, maybe we have made her blind.
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away.
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made.


But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark.
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are.
And you don't have to change a thing.
The world could change its heart.

Oh, oh, oh.
Oh-oh, oh, oh.
And you don't have to change a thing.
The world could change its heart.




She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving.
You know, covergirls eat nothing.
She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything".
"What's a little bit of hunger?".

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it.
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh.
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror.
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within.



There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark.
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are.
And you don't have to change a thing.
The world could change its heart.




No better you than the you that you are.
No better you than the you that you are.
No better life than the life we're living.
No better life than the life we're living.

No better time for your shine, you're a star.
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful.



And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark.
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are.
And you don't have to change a thing.
The world could change its heart.
