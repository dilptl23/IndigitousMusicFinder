the splendor of a king, clothed in majesty.
let all the earth rejoice.
all the earth rejoice.
he wraps himself in light, and darkness tries to hide.

trembles at his voice.
how great is our god, sing with me.
how great is our god, and all will see.
how great, how great is our god.

and time is in his hands.
beginning and the end.
beginning and the end.
the godhead, three in one.

the lion and the lamb.
the lion and the lamb.
name above all names.
worthy of all praise.

how great is our god.
how great is our god, sing with me.
how great is our god, and all will see.
how great, how great is our god.
