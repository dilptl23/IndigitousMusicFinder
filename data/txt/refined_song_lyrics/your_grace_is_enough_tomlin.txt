great is your faithfulness oh god.
you wrestle with the sinner's heart.
you lead us by still waters and to mercy.
and nothing can keep us apart.

remember your children.
remember your promise.
oh god.
your grace is enough.

your grace is enough for me.
great is your love and justice god.
you use the weak to lead the strong.
you lead us in the song of your salvation.

so remember your people.
remember your children.
remember your promise.
oh god.

your grace is enough.
your grace is enough for me.
so remember your people.
remember your children.

oh god.
your grace is enough.
your grace is enough.
your grace is enough for me.

heaven reaching down to us.
your grace is enough for me.
god i see your grace is enough.
i'm covered in your love.
