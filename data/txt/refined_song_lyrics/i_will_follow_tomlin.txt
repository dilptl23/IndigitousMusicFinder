where you go, i'll go.
where you stay, i'll stay.
when you move, i'll move.
i will follow.

all your ways are sure.
i will trust in you alone.
higher than my side.
high above my life.

where you go, i'll go.
where you stay, i'll stay.
when you move, i'll move.
i will follow you.

how you serve i'll serve.
if this life i lose, i will follow you.
i will follow you.
light unto the world.
