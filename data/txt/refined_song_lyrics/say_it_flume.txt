Feeling the song, party done.
Shadows walking home.
Walking with our game on.
You are my kind, classic mind.

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Loving the cold, smoke a roll.
See your fingers shake.
I'm getting through your heart break.

Don't know what I need.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

Don't doubt me babe.
You make me wanna change.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....

You make me love the pain.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....

When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Got me falling right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Let me fuck you right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.


I'm getting the door, silent walk.
Whose the first to speak?.
Speak it like a real freak.
Voice in my head, in my bed.

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Taking your time, work my mind.
And I play with you.
I play pretend it's so true.

Listen 'round to the deep dark sound.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

Don't doubt me babe.
You make me wanna change.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....

You make me love the pain.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....

When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Got me falling right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Let me fuck you right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.


Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Don't doubt me babe.
You make me wanna change.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....

You make me love the pain.
Break my bed to make me wanna stay.
I can't....

When you say it like that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Got me falling right back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
