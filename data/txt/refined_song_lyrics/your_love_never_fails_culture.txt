nothing can separate.
even if i ran away.
your love never fails.
i know i still make mistakes.

your love never fails.
you stay the same through the ages.
your love never changes.
there maybe pain in the night but joy comes in the morning.

i don't have to be afraid.
because i know that you love me.
your love never fails.
the wind is strong and the water's deep.

cause your love never fails.
the chasm is far too wide.
i never thought i'd reach the other side.
but your love never fails.
