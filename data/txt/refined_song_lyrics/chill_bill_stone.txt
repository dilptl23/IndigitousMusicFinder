Rob $tone two damn phones.
Babylons can't crack the code.
Used to sip out styrofoam but figured I should stick to dro (weed!).
Backwoods overload don't like to smoke them swishers hoe.


Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed.
I said baby just buy dutches cause you can't smoke for free.
I got some loud but no money babe buy me a Fiji.
She said you need a job, bitch fuck a job I still get cheese.

Two cell phones, Mr. Mothafuck-a-thot.
Mr. I be on that block.
Twelve o seven fuck an op.
They hear my name they see my squad.

I'm with your bitch she on my jock.
Ain't got no time to love a thot.
Got niggas mad my flow so hot.
Got niggas mad my squad won't stop.

I'm sippin water out the Voss.
Got lean all in my fuckin' Sprite.
Turnin up on fuckin sight.
Mr. Kenny Powers bouta take your girlfriend home tonight, bitch.

And I'm smokin' on that widow.
When you see it out the window.
Got a dusty old tee.
Lookin' bummy leave it simple.

So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little.
And my brothas beside me so fuck it we mobbin' deep.
Always grimey, no findin' me.
But I be in LG.

I live by the lemon cause that fucka chose me.
