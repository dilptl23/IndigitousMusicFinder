Happy Days.
Sunday, Monday, happy days..
Tuesday, Wednesday, happy days..
Thursday, Friday, happy days..


These days are....
Won't you be mine? (oh, happy days).
These days are....
Oh, please be mine. (oh, happy days).

Hello sunshine, goodbye rain..
She's wearing my school ring on her chain..
She's my steady, I'm her man..
I'm gonna love her all I can..

Gonna cruise her around the town,.
Show everybody what I found..
Rock and roll with all my friends,.
Hopin' the music never ends..


Sunday, Monday, happy days..
Tuesday, Wednesday, happy days..
Thursday, Friday, happy days..
Saturday, what a day, rockin' all week for you..




Goodbye gray sky, hello blue,.
'Cause nothing can hold me when I hold you..
Feels so right, can't be wrong,.
A-rockin' and rollin' all week long..



Hello sunshine, goodbye rain..
She's wearing my school ring on her chain..
She's my steady, I'm her man..
Now I'm gonna love her all I can..



These happy days are yours and mine..
Won't you be mine? (oh, happy days).
These happy days are yours and mine..
Oh, please be mine. (oh, happy days).
