you call me out upon the waters.
the great unknown where feet may fail.
and there i find you in the mystery.
in oceans deep.

and i will call upon your name.
and keep my eyes above the waves.
when oceans rise.
my soul will rest in your embrace.

your grace abounds in deepest waters.
your sovereign hand.
will be my guide.
where feet may fail and fear surrounds me.

so i will call upon your name.
and keep my eyes above the waves.
when oceans rise.
my soul will rest in your embrace.

spirit lead me where my trust is without borders.
let me walk upon the waters.
wherever you would call me.
take me deeper than my feet could ever wander.

in the presence of my savior.
oh, jesus, you're my god!.
i will call upon your name.
keep my eyes above the waves.
