Do that one dance baby.
That, that one dance.
Yeah, oh.
You don't know how to do that?.

Come on, I'm old and I'm trying to learn it.
Well yeah, do it.


Girl 1: Oh my god, oh my god. Girl ain't that Zay and Zayion?.
Girl 2: Yas.
Girl 1: Don't both of 'em got a girlfriend?.
Girl 2: Girl I don't care.

Girl 2: Oh yes.


Walked in this party.
And these girls lookin' at me.
Skinny jeans on and you know my hair nappy.
Hey, hey, hey.

I want y'all do it, do this dance now.



JuJu on the beat.
JuJu on that beat.
JuJu on that, JuJu on that, JuJu on that beat.
Now slide, drop.

Don't stop, aye.

Running man on that beat, aye.

Aye, aye.
Do your dance, aye.
Go crazy, aye.
Get freaky, aye.

Hey, hey, hey.
Yea.


Okay we knuckin' and buckin'.
And ready to fight.
I got my cousin, he with me.
And got Lil Zay on the right.

And I don't know nothing else.
Besides drinking and having parties.
And having some fun.
I say look in the mirror.

I see a 300-S.
And got them blacked out rims.
I mean I like your style.
I'm on a whole 'nother level.

There wouldn't be no comparings.


JuJu on the beat.
JuJu on that beat.
JuJu on that, JuJu on that, JuJu on that beat.
Now slide, drop.

Don't stop, aye.
Don't stop, aye.
Running man on that beat, aye.
Running man on that beat, aye.
