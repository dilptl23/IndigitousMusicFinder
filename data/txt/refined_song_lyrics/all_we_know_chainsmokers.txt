Fighting flames of fire.
Hang onto burning wires.
We don't care anymore.
Are we fading lovers?.

Maybe we should let this go.

We're falling apart, still we hold together.
We've passed the end, so we chase forever.
'Cause this is all we know.
This feeling's all we know.

Down the streets right through the city.
I'll go everywhere you go.
From Chicago to the coast.
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go.

'Cause this is all we know.

'Cause this is all we know.
'Cause this is all we know.

Never face each other.
One bed different covers.
We don't care anymore.
Two hearts still beating.

Maybe we should let this go.

We're falling apart, still we hold together.
We've passed the end, so we chase forever.
'Cause this is all we know.
This feeling's all we know.

Down the streets right through the city.
I'll go everywhere you go.
From Chicago to the coast.
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go.

'Cause this is all we know.
