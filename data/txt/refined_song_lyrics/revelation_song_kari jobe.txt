worthy is the lamb who was slain.
holy, holy is he.
sing a new song to him who sits on.
heaven's mercy seat.

holy, holy is he.

clothed in rainbows of living color.
flashes of lighting rolls of thunder.

such a marvelous mystery.

you are worthy.
holy, holy, holy is the lord god almighty.
who was and is and is to come.
with all creation i sing praise to the king of kings.
