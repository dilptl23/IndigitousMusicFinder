there is love that came for us.
humbled to a sinner's cross.
you broke my shame and sinfulness,.
you rose again victorious..

through the storm and through the fire.
there is truth that sets me free.
jesus christ who lives in me!.
you are stronger, you are stronger.

it is written, christ is risen!.
jesus you are lord of all!.
no beginning and no end.
you're my hope and my defense.
