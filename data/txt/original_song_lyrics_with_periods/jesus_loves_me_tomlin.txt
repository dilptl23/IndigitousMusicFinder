i was lost.
i was in chains.
the world had a hold of me.
my heart was a stone.
i was covered in shame.
when he came for me.
i couldn't run, couldn't run from his presence.
i couldn't run, couldn't run from his arms.
jesus, he loves me, he loves me, he is for me.
jesus, how can it be, he loves me, he is for me.
and it was a fire.
deep in my soul.
i'll never be the same.
i stepped out of the dark.
and into the light.
when he called my name.
i couldn't run, couldn't run from his presence.
i couldn't run, couldn't run from his arms.
jesus, he loves me, he loves me, he is for me.
jesus, how can it be, he loves me, he is for me.
he holds the stars and he holds my heart.
with healing hands that bear the scars.
the rugged cross where he died for me.
my only hope, my everything.
jesus, he loves me.
he loves me, oh.
jesus, how can it be, he loves me, he is for me.
he loves me (he loves me, he loves me).
he is for me (he loves me, he loves me).
my god it's amazing oh.
jesus loves me.
