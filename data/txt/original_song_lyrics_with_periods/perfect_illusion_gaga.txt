Tryin' to keep control.
Pressure's takin' its toll.
Stuck in the middle zone.
I just want you alone.
My guessing game is strong.
Way too real to be wrong.
Caught up in your show.
Yeah, at least now I know.

It wasn't love, it wasn't love.
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion).
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love.
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion).
You were a perfect illusion.

I don't need eyes to see.
I felt you touchin' me.
High like amphetamine.
Maybe you're just a dream.
That's what it means to crush.
Now that I'm wakin' up.
I still feel the blow.
But at least now I know.

It wasn't love, it wasn't love.
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion).
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love.
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion).

(Where are you?.
Cause I can't see you).
It was a perfect illusion.
(But I feel you watchin' me.
Dilated, falling free.
In a modern ecstasy).

(Where are you?.
Cause I can't see you).
It was a perfect illusion.

Mistaken for love.

In a modern ecstasy).
Mistaken for love.

In a modern ecstasy).

I'm over the show.
Yeah at least now I know.

It wasn't love, it wasn't love.
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion).
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love.
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion).
Ohhhh.
You were a perfect illusion.
Ohhhh.
It was a perfect illusion.
It was a perfect illusion.
Somewhere in all the confusion.
It was a perfect illusion, (illusion) (illusion).
It was a perfect illusion.
Somewhere in all the confusion.
You were so perfect.
You were a, you were a perfect illusion.
