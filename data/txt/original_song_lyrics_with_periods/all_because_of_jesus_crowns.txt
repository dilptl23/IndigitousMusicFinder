giver of every perfect thing.
to you be the glory.
maker of heaven and of earth.
no one can comprehend your worth.

to you be the glory.
and i am alive because i'm alive in you.
it's all because of jesus i'm alive.
it's all because the blood of jesus christ.
that covers me and raised this dead man's life.
it's all because of jesus i'm alive.
i'm alive, i'm alive.
giver of every breath i breathe.
author of all eternity.
giver of every perfect thing.
to you be the glory.
maker of heaven and of earth.
no one can comprehend your worth.
king over all the universe.
to you be the glory.
and i am alive because i'm alive in you.
it's all because of jesus i'm alive.
it's all because the blood of jesus christ.
that covers me and raised this dead man's life.
it's all because of jesus.
every sunrise sings your praise.
the universe cries out your praise.
i'm singing freedom all my days.
now that i'm alive.
i'm alive, i'm alive, i'm alive.
