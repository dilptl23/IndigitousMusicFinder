I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah.
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah.
Milli point 2 just to hurt you, ah.
All red lamb just to tease you, ah.
None of these toys on lease too, ah.
Made your whole year in a week too, yah.
Main bitch out of your league too, ah.
Side bitch out of your league too, ah.


House so empty need a centerpiece.
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony.
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces.
Then she clean it with her face, man.
I love my baby.
You talking money need a hearing aid.
You talking bout me I don't see the shade.
Switch up my style I take any lane.
I switch up my cup I kill any pain.


(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha).
Look what you've done!.
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha).
I'm a mother fuckin' Starboy.

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah.
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah.
Pull off in that roadster sv, ah.
Pockets over weight gettin hefty, ah.
Coming for the king that's a far cry I.
I come alive in the fall time I.
No competition I don't really listen.
I'm in the blue mulsanne bumping New Edition.

Let a nigga Brad Pitt legend of the fall.
Took the year like a bandit.
Bought momma a crib and a brand new wagon.
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin lavish.
Star Trek groove in that Wrath of Khan.
Girls get loose when they hear the song.
Hundred on the dash get me close to God.
We don't pray for love we just pray for cars.
