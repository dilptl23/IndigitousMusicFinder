the greatest day in history.
death is beaten, you have rescued me.
sing it out, jesus is alive.
the empty cross, the empty grave.
life eternal, you have won the day.
shout it out, jesus is alive.
he's alive.
oh, happy day, happy day.
you washed my sin away.
oh, happy day, happy day.
i'll never be the same.
forever i am changed.
when i stand in that place.
free at last, meeting face to face.
i am yours, jesus, you are mine.
endless joy, perfect peace.
earthly pain finally will cease.
celebrate, jesus is alive.
he's alive.
and oh, happy day, happy day.
you washed my sin away.
oh, happy day, happy day.
i'll never be the same.
oh no, forever i am changed.
oh, what a glorious day.
what a glorious way.
that you have saved me.
and oh, what a glorious day.
what a glorious name.
hey, and oh, happy day, happy day.
you washed my sin away.
oh, happy day, happy day.
i'll never be the same.
oh no, forever i am changed.
what a glorious, glorious day.
i'll never be the same.
