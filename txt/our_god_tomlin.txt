water you turned into wine
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you
none like you
into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there`s no one like you
none like you
our god is greater, our god is stronger
god you are higher than any other
our god is healer, awesome in power
our god, our god
into the darkness you shining
out of the ashes we rise
no one like you
none like you
our god is greater, our god is stronger
god you are higher than any other
our god is healer, awesome in power
our god, our god
our god is greater, our god is stronger
god you are higher than any other
our god is healer, awesome in power
our god, our god
and if our god is for us, then who could ever stop us
and if our god is with us, then what can stand against?
and if our god is for us, then who could ever stop us
and if our god is with us, then what can stand against?
then what can stand against?
