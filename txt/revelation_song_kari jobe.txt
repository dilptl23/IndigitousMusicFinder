worthy is the lamb who was slain
holy, holy is he
sing a new song to him who sits on
heaven's mercy seat
worthy is the lamb who was slain
holy, holy is he

heaven's mercy seat
holy, holy, holy is the lord god almighty
who was and is and is to come
with all creation i sing praise to the king of kings
you are my everything and i will adore you
clothed in rainbows of living color
flashes of lighting rolls of thunder

to you the only wise king
holy, holy, holy is the lord god almighty
who was and is and is to come
with all creation i sing praise to the king of kings
you are my everything and i will adore you

at the mention of your name
jesus your name is power, breath and living water
such a marvelous mystery
oh, you're worthy, mystery

who was and is and is to come
with all creation i sing praise to the king of kings
you are my everything and i will adore you, i will adore you
