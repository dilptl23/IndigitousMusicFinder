we fall down
we lay our crowns
at the feet of jesus
the greatness of
mercy and love
at the feet of jesus
and we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
is the lamb
we fall down
we lay our crowns
at the feet of jesus
the greatness of
your mercy and love
at the feet of jesus
and we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
is the lamb
and we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
is the lamb
we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
we cry holy, holy, holy
is the lamb
