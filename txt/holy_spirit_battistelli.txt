there's nothing worth more
that could ever come close
no thing can compare
you're our living hope
your presence, lord
i've tasted and seen
of the sweetest of loves
where my heart becomes free
and my shame is undone
your presence, lord
holy spirit, you are welcome here
come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
your glory, god, is what our hearts long for
to be overcome by your presence, lord
your presence, lord
there's nothing worth more
that could ever come close
no thing can compare
you're our living hope
your presence, lord
i've tasted and seen
of the sweetest of loves
where my heart becomes free
and my shame is undone
your presence, lord
holy spirit, you are welcome here
come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
your glory, god, is what our hearts long for
to be overcome by your presence, lord
your presence, lord
let us become more aware of your presence
let us experience the glory of your goodness
let us become more aware of your presence
let us experience the glory of your goodness
let us become more aware of your presence
let us experience the glory of your goodness
let us become more aware of your presence
let us experience the glory of your goodness
holy spirit, you are welcome here
come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
your glory, god, is what our hearts long for
to be overcome by your presence, lord
