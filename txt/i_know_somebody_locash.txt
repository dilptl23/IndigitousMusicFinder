I Know Somebody
LoCash

Girl I've never seen you in this town
If you need somebody to show you around, well
I know somebody
It's a little too loud to talk in here
And your eyes are sayin' you wanna disappear, well
I know a place and I know somebody

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),
I know somebody

I'm lovin' the way you act so shy
Like you ain't sure, like you can't decide
But I heard you tell your friends that you know somebody
That makes you laugh, that can get you home
That might make you fall ‘fore the night is gone
So come on, you know I'm that somebody

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),
I know somebody

That's lookin' for a girl like you
Could fall in a kiss or two
Baby tell me what you wanna do
Cause I know

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside

I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody
