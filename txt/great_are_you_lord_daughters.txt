you give life, you are love
you bring light to the darkness
you give hope, you restore
every heart that is broken
great are you, lord
it's your breath in our lungs
so we pour out our praise
we pour out our praise
it's your breath in our lungs
so we pour out our praise to you only
you give life, you are love
you bring light to the darkness
you give hope, you restore
every heart that is broken
great are you, lord
all the earth will shout your praise
our hearts will cry, these bones will sing
great are you, lord
