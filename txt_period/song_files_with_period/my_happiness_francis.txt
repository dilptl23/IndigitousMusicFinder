My Happiness.
Connie Francis.
Evening shadows make me blue.
When each weary day is through.

Every day I reminisce.
Dreaming of your tender kiss.
Always thinking how I miss my happiness.
A million years it seems.

But I'll hold you again.
There'll be no blue memories then.
Whether skies are gray or blue.
Any place on earth will do.
