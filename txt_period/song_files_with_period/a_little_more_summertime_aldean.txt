They're boarding up this water town.
Ain't nobody hanging 'round.
Another gray September day.
Was I crazy to think she'd stay.

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer.
If those blue water waves could've stayed at her feet on the beach 'stead of going out with the tide.
If that wind was a friend it'd still be blowing in like a warm southern whisper on her.
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I.
Had a little more summertime.

I brace myself against the cold.
Let her memory take hold.
Stirring that old fire up.
As if I don't miss her enough.

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer.
If those blue water waves could've stayed at her feet on the beach 'stead of going out with the tide.
If that wind was a friend it'd still be blowing in like a warm southern whisper on her.
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I.
Had a little more summertime.

Just a little more summertime.

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer.
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I.
Had a little more summertime.
