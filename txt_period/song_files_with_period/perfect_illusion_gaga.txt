Perfect Illusion
Lady Gaga

Tryin' to keep control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone

Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)


I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream

Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

(Where are you?
Cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me

In a modern ecstasy)

(Where are you?
Cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me

Illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love
(Where were you

But I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love
(Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy)

(In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy)

I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

You were a perfect illusion
Ohhhh
It was a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion

It was a perfect illusion, (illusion) (illusion)
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect
