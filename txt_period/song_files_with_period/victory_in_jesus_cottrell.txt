i heard an old, old story,.
how a savior came from glory,.
how he gave his life on calvary.
to save a wretch like me;.

of his precious blood's atoning,.
then i repented of my sins.
and won the victory..
o victory in jesus,.

he sought me and bought me.
with his redeeming blood;.
he loved me ere i knew him.
and all my love is due him,.

beneath the cleansing flood..
i heard about his healing,.
of his cleansing pow'r revealing..
how he made the lame to walk again.

and then i cried, "dear jesus,.
come and heal my broken spirit,".
and somehow jesus came and bro't.
to me the victory..

my savior, forever..
he sought me and bought me.
with his redeeming blood;.
he loved me ere i knew him.

he plunged me to victory,.
beneath the cleansing flood..
i heard about a mansion.
he has built for me in glory..

beyond the crystal sea;.
about the angels singing,.
and the old redemption story,.
and some sweet day i'll sing up there.

o victory in jesus,.
my savior, forever..
he sought me and bought me.
with his redeeming blood;.
