heaven thundered.
and the world was born.
life begins and ends.
in the dust you formed.
faith commanded.
and the mountains moved.
fear is losing ground.
to our hope in you.
unstoppable god.
let your glory go on and on.
impossible things.
in your name they shall be done (oh).
freedom conquered.
all our chains undone.
sin defeated.
jesus has overcome.
mercy triumphed.
when the third day dawned.
darkness was denied.
when the stone was gone.
nothing shall be impossible.
your kingdom reigns unstoppable.
we'll shout your praise forevermore.
jesus our god unstoppable.
