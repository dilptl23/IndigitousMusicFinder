heaven thundered.
and the world was born.
life begins and ends.
in the dust you formed.

and the mountains moved.
fear is losing ground.
to our hope in you.
unstoppable god.

impossible things.
in your name they shall be done (oh).
freedom conquered.
all our chains undone.

jesus has overcome.
mercy triumphed.
when the third day dawned.
darkness was denied.
