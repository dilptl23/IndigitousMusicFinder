seated above, enthroned in the father's love.
destined to die, poured out for all mankind.
god's only son, perfect and spotless one.
he never sinned but suffered as if he did.

every victory is yours.
all authority.
every victory is yours.
savior, worthy of honor and glory.

jesus, awesome in power forever.
awesome and great is your name, you overcame.
power in hand speaking the father's plan.
you're sending us out, light in this broken land.
