come, set your rule and reign.
in our hearts again.
increase in us we pray.
unveil why we're made.

like wildfire in our very souls.
holy spirit come invade us now.
we are your church.
we need your power in us.

we hunger and we thirst.
refuse to waste our lives.
for you're our joy and prize.
to see the captive hearts released.

we lay down our lives for heaven's cause.
we are your church.
we pray: revive this earth.
build your kingdom here.

show your mighty hand.
heal our streets and land.
set your church on fire.
win this nation back.

build your kingdom here.
we pray.
unleash your kingdoms power.
reaching the near and far.

your beauty changing hearts.
you made us for much more than this.
awake the kingdom seed in us.
fill us with the strength and love of christ.

we are the hope on earth.
build your kingdom here.
let the darkness fear.
show your mighty hand.

set your church on fire.
win this nation back.
change the atmosphere.
build your kingdom here.

build your kingdom here.
let the darkness fear.
show your mighty hand.
heal our streets and land.
