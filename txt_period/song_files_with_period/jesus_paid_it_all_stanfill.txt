i hear the savior say, thy strength indeed is small.
child of weakness, watch and pray, find in me thine all in all.
'cause jesus paid it all.
all to him i owe.
sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
lord, now indeed i find thy power and thine alone.
can change the leper's spots and melt the heart of stone.
'cause jesus paid it all.
all to him i owe.
my sin had left this crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
it's washed away, all my sin.
and all my shame.
and when before the throne i stand in him complete.
"jesus died my soul to save" my lips shall still repeat.
jesus paid it all.
all to him i owe.
(sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow).
(he washed it white as snow).
(o praise the one who paid my debt.
and raised this life up from the dead).
(o praise the one who paid my debt.
and raised this life up from the dead).
(o praise the one who paid my debt.
and raised this life up from the dead).
(o praise the one who paid my debt.
and raised this life up from the dead).
(o praise the one who paid my debt.
and raised this life up from the dead).
well praise the one who paid my debt and raised this life up from the dead.
jesus.
you are the one.
the son of god.
conqueror of death.
king of kings.
the sacrificial lamb.
(o praise the one who paid my debt.
and raised this life up from the dead).
well praise the one who paid my debt and raised this life up from the dead.
jesus.
