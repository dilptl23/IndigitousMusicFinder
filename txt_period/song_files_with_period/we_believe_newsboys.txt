in this time of desperation.
when all we know is doubt and fear.
there is only one foundation.
we believe, we believe.

when all is dark, you help us see.
there is only one salvation.
we believe, we believe.
we believe in god the father.

we believe in the holy spirit.
and he's given us new life.
we believe in the crucifixion.
we believe that he conquered death.

and he's comin' back again, we believe.
so, let our faith be more than anthems.
greater than the songs we sing.
and in our weakness and temptations.

we believe in god the father!.
we believe in jesus christ!.
we believe in the holy spirit!.
and he's given us new life!.

we believe that he conquered death!.
we believe in the resurrection!.
and he's comin' back again!.
let the lost be found and the dead be raised!.

let the church live loud our god we'll say.
we believe, we believe!.
and the gates of hell will not prevail!.
for the power of god, has torn the veil!.

we believe, we believe!.
we believe in god the father.
we believe in jesus christ.
we believe in the holy spirit.

we believe in the crucifixion!.
we believe that he conquered death!.
we believe in the resurrection!.
and he's comin' back,.
