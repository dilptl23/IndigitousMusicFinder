Chill Bill.
Rob Stone.
Rob $tone two damn phones.
Babylons can't crack the code.

Backwoods overload don't like to smoke them swishers hoe.
If you hit my liquor store it's 50 cents for single Ports.
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed.
I said baby just buy dutches cause you can't smoke for free.

She said you need a job, bitch fuck a job I still get cheese.
Two cell phones, Mr. Mothafuck-a-thot.
Mr. I be on that block.
Twelve o seven fuck an op.

Rolling dope up on the spot.
I'm with your bitch she on my jock.
Ain't got no time to love a thot.
Got niggas mad my flow so hot.

We in the game won't take no loss.
I'm sippin water out the Voss.
Got lean all in my fuckin' Sprite.
Turnin up on fuckin sight.

And I'm smokin' on that widow.
When you see it out the window.
Got a dusty old tee.
Lookin' bummy leave it simple.

So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little.
And my brothas beside me so fuck it we mobbin' deep.
Always grimey, no findin' me.
But I be in LG.

I live by the lemon cause that fucka chose me.
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed.
I said baby just buy dutches cause you can't smoke for free.
I got some loud but no money babe buy me a Fiji.
