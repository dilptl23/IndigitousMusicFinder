savior i come.
quiet my soul remember.
redemption's hill.
where your blood was spilled.

everything i once held dear.
i count it all as loss.
lead me to the cross.
where your love poured out.

lord i lay me down.
rid me of myself.
i belong to you.
lead me, lead me to the cross.

tempted and trialed.
human.
the word became flesh.
bore my sin and death.

everything i once held dear.
i count it all as loss.
to your heart.
to your heart.
