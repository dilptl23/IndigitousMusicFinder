we've waited for this day.
we're gathered in your name.
calling out to you.
your glory like a fire.

will burn our hearts with truth.
you're the reason we're here.
you're the reason we're singing.
open up the heavens.

open up the floodgates.
a mighty river.
flowing from your heart.
filling every part of our praise.

your glory on our face.
we're looking to the sky.
descending like a cloud.
you're standing with us now.

you're the reason we're here.
you're the reason we're singing.
show us, show us your glory.
show us, show us your power.
