light of the world.
you stepped down into darkness.
opened my eyes let me see.
beauty that made this heart adore you.

here i am to worship.
here i am to bow down.
here i am to say that you?re my god.
you're altogether lovely.

altogether wonderful to me.
king of all days.
oh so highly exalted.
glorious in heaven above.

all for love?s sake became poor.
i'll never know how much it cost.
to see my sin upon that cross.
call:.
