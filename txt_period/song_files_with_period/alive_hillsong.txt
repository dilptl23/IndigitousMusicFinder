i was lost with a broken heart.
you picked me up, now i'm set apart.
from the ash i am born again.
forever safe in the saviour's hands.

i'll follow you lord for all my days.
i'll fix my eyes, follow in your ways.
forever free in unending grace.
'cause you are, you are, you are my freedom.

your love, your love, your love never ending.
oh oh oh.
you are alive in us.
nothing can take your place.

your love has set us free.
in the midst of the darkest night.
let your love be the shining light.
breaking chains that were holding me.

everything of this world will fade.
i'm pressing on till i see your face.
i will live that your will be done.
i won't stop till your kingdom come.

we lift you higher, lift you higher.
your love, your love, your love never ending.
oh oh oh.
you are alive in us.

you are all we need.
your love has set us free.
you are, you are, you are my freedom.
we lift you higher.

we lift you higher, lift you higher.
your love, your love, your love never ending.
oh oh oh.
you are alive in us.

you are all we need.
your love has set us free.
you are alive in us.
nothing can take your place.
