No Problem.
Chance the Rapper.
You don't want zero problems, big fella!.
Yep!.

It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail.

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail.
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!".

Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand.
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap.
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey.
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?.

You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love.
Not me, though, bitch you can keep those.
Bruh, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo.
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho.

If one more label try to stop me.
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.

Pull up in the new thing, I'm like.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.

They be like, "There he go!".
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off.
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter.
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt.

Where the hell you get them from?.
Yeezy said he ain't make them.
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters.
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas.

Got a pocket full of money.
And a mind full of ideas.
Some of this shit may sound weird.
Inside of the Maybach.

Run shit like diarrhea.
Big yacht, no pies there.
Aye, aye, captain.
I'm high, captain.

Me and God dappin'.
This is my blessin'.
This is my passion.
School of hard knocks.

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
Yep, yep!.
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like.

I got problems bigger than these boys.
My deposits, they be on steroids.
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter.
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter.

My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks.
I rolled up and let the smoke puff.
I lay down, told yah.
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff.

In the streets my face a coupon.
Her pussy too warm.
All these bitches come to do harm.
Just bought a new charm.

I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes.
Pretty bitches, centerfolds.
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes.
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase.

Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?.
What you thought it was?.
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz.
And if that label try to stop me.

Mula, baby.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail.

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail.
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!".

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me.
