Happy Birthday, Sweet Sixteen.
Neil Sedaka.
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la.
Happy birthday sweet sixteen.

Happy birthday sweet sixteen.
Tonight's the night I've waited for.
Because you're not a baby anymore.
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen,.

What happened to that funny face.
My little tomboy now wears satins and lace.
I can't believe my eyes you're just a teenage dream.
Happy birthday sweet sixteen.

Then when a you were ten we didn't like each other.
When you were thirteen You was a funny valentine.
But since you've grown up Your future is sewn up.
From now on you're gonna be mine, so.

It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes.
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen.
Happy birthday sweet sixteen.
If I should smile with sweet surprise.

You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen.
Happy birthday sweet sixteen.
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet sixteen.
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet sixteen.
