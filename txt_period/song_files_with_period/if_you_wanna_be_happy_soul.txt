If You Wanna Be Happy.
Jimmy Soul.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life.
Never make a pretty woman your wife.

Get an ugly girl to marry you.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life.
Never make a pretty woman your wife.
So for my personal point of view.

A pretty woman makes her husband look small.
And very often causes his downfall.
As soon as he married her and then she starts.
To do the things that will break his heart.

A-you'll be happy for the rest of your life.
An ug-a-ly woman cooks meals on time.
And she'll always give you peace of mind.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life.

So for my personal point of view.
Get an ugly girl to marry you.
Don't let your friends say you have no taste.
Go ahead and marry anyway.

Take it from me, she's a better catch.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life.
Never make a pretty woman your wife.
So for my personal point of view.

[Spoken:].
Say man!.
Hey baby!.
I saw your wife the other day!.

Yeah, an' she's ug-leeee!.
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby!.
Yeah, alright!.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life.

So for my personal point of view.
Get an ugly girl to marry you.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life.
Never make a pretty woman your wife.

Get an ugly girl to marry you.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life.
Never make a pretty woman your wife.
So for my personal point of view.
