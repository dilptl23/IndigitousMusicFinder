christ is my reward.
and all of my devotion.
now there's nothing in this world.
that could ever satisfy.

my soul will sing.
no turning back.
i've been set free.
christ is enough for me.

everything i need is in you.
everything i need.
christ my all in all.
the joy of my salvation.

heaven is our home.
through every storm.
my soul will sing.
jesus is here.

i have decided to follow jesus.
no turning back.
no turning back.
the cross before me.
