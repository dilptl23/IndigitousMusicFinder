The Happy Organ .
Dave Cortez.
The best things in life are free, but you can give them to the birds and bees.
I need money.

(That's what I want. That's what I want.).
That's what I want, that 's what I want.
(That's what I want. That's what I want.).
Your love gives me such a thrill, but your love don't pay my bills.

That's what I want.
(That's what I want. That's what I want.).
That's what I want, that 's what I want.
(That's what I want. That's what I want.).

I need money.
That's what I want.
(That's what I want. That's what I want.).
That's what I want, that 's what I want.

Money, lots of money.
(That's what I want, uh huh.).
Whole lot of money.
(That's what I want, uh huh.).

(That's what I want, uh huh. That's what I want.).
(That's what I want, uh huh. That's what I want.).
Money, lots of money.
(That's what I want, uh huh.).
