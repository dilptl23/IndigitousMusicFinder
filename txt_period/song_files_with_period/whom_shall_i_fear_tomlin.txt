you hear me when i call.
you are my morning song.
though darkness fills the night.
it cannot hide the light.

you crush the enemy.
underneath my feet.
you are my sword and shield.
though troubles linger still.

i know who goes before me.
i know who stands behind.
the god of angel armies.
is always by my side.

he is a friend of mine.
the god of angel armies.
is always by my side.
my strength is in your name.

you will deliver me.
yours is the victory.
whom shall i fear.
whom shall i fear.

i know who stands behind.
the god of angel armies.
is always by my side.
the one who reigns forever.

the god of angel armies.
is always by my side.
and nothing formed against me shall stand.
you hold the whole world in your hands.

you are faithful.
you are faithful.
nothing formed against me shall stand.
you hold the whole world in your hands.

you are faithful.
you are faithful.
you are faithful.
i know who goes before me.

the god of angel armies.
is always by my side.
the one who reigns forever.
he is a friend of mine.

is always by my side.
i know who goes before me.
i know who stands behind.
the god of angel armies.

the one who reigns forever.
he is a friend of mine.
the god of angel armies.
is always by my side.
