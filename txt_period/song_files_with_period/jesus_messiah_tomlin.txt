he became sin, who knew no sin.
that we might become his righteousness.
he humbled himself and carried the cross.
love so amazing, love so amazing.

blessed redeemer, emmanuel.
the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven.
jesus messiah, lord of all.
his body the bread, his blood the wine.

the whole earth trembled, and the veil was torn.
love so amazing, love so amazing, yeah.
jesus messiah, name above all names.
blessed redeemer, emmanuel.

jesus messiah, lord of all.
all our hope is in you, all our hope is in you.
all the glory to you, god, the light of the world.
jesus messiah, name above all names.
