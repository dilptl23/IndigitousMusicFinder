come out of sadness.
from wherever you've been.
come broken hearted.
let rescue begin.
come find your mercy.
oh sinner come kneel.
earth has no sorrow.
that heaven can't heal.
earth has no sorrow.
that heaven can't heal.
so lay down your burdens.
lay down your shame.
all who are broken.
lift up your face.
oh wanderer come home.
you're not too far.
so lay down your hurt.
lay down your heart.
come as you are.
there's hope for the hopeless.
and all those who've strayed.
come sit at the table.
come taste the grace.
there's rest for the weary.
rest that endures.
earth has no sorrow.
that heaven can't cure.
so lay down your burdens.
lay down your shame.
all who are broken.
lift up your face.
oh wanderer come home.
you're not too far.
lay down your hurt.
lay down your heart.
come as you are.
come as you are.
fall in his arms.
come as you are.
there's joy for the morning.
oh sinner be still.
earth has no sorrow.
that heaven can't heal.
earth has no sorrow.
that heaven can't heal.
