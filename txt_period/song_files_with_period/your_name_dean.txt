as morning dawns and evening fades.
you inspire songs of praise.
that rise from earth to touch your heart and glorify your name.
your name is a strong and mighty tower.
your name is a shelter like no other.
your name, let the nations sing it louder.
'cause nothing has the power to save.
but your name.
jesus, in your name we pray.
come and fill our hearts today.
lord, give us strength to live for you and glorify your name.
your name is a strong and mighty tower.
your name is a shelter like no other.
your name, let the nations sing it louder.
'cause nothing has the power to save but your name.
your name is a strong and mighty tower.
your name is a shelter like no other.
your name, let the nations sing it louder.
'cause nothing has the power to save but.
(nothing has the power).
your name is a strong and mighty tower.
your name is a shelter like no other.
your name, let the nations sing it louder.
'cause nothing has the power to save but your name.
