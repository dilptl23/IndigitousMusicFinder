you search much deeper within.
through the ways things appear.

how much you deserve? lord.
though i'm weak and poor.
all i have is yours.
every single breath.
i'll bring you more than a song.
for a song in itself.
is not what you have required.
you search much deeper.
you search much deeper within.
through the way things appear.
you're looking into my heart.
i'm comin' back to the heart of worship.
