how deep the fatherâ€™s love for us,.
how vast beyond all measure,.
that he should give his only son.
to make a wretch his treasure..

the father turns his face away,.
as wounds which mar the chosen one.
bring many sons to glory..
behold the man upon a cross,.

ashamed, i hear my mocking voice.
call out among the scoffers..
it was my sin that held him there.
until it was accomplished;.

i know that it is finished..
i will not boast in anything,.
no gifts, no power, no wisdom;.
but i will boast in jesus christ,.
