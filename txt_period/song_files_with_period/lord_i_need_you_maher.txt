lord, i come, i confess.
bowing here i find my rest.
without you i fall apart.
you're the one that guides my heart.

every hour i need you.
my one defense, my righteousness.
oh god, how i need you.
where sin runs deep your grace is more.

and where you are, lord, i am free.
holiness is christ in me.
lord, i need you, oh, i need you.
every hour i need you.

oh god, how i need you.
teach my song to rise to you.
when temptation comes my way.
and when i cannot stand i'll fall on you.

lord, i need you, oh, i need you.
every hour i need you.
my one defense, my righteousness.
oh god, how i need you.
