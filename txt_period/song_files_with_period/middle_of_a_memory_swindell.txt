Middle Of A Memory.
Cole Swindell.
Baby, it just took one look at you.
For me to change my one drink order to two.

Like we been talking all night.
About a minute into our first dance.
We got blindsided by your friends.
All in a hurry like you had to go.

Girl, you can't leave someone.
In the middle of a dance floor all alone.
In the middle of an old school country song.
Right when I was just about to lean on in.

Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light.
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives.
Girl, it ain't right, no.
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?.

People'd be staring while I spin you 'round.
Thinking we were so in love, yeah.
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up.
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine.

But now I don't know where you are.
I'm under these lights right here in the dark.
In the middle of a dance floor all alone.
In the middle of an old school country song.

Why'd you have to go then?.
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light.
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives.
Girl, it ain't right, no.

Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie.
Tore the back half out of a book.
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me.
It ain't right saying goodbye.

In the middle of what could've been our song.
Right when I was just about to lean on in.
Why'd you have to go then?.
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light.
