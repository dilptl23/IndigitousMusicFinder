Love Can Make You Happy.
Mercy.
Wake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes .
And the smell of flowers blooming fills the air. .

Love; .
Your life is filled with joy when she is there. .
Love can make you happy if you fine someone who cares .
To giiiive a life time to you and who has a love to shaaare. .

Then it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay). .
To have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase .
That means the love you've found is going to stay. .
Love can make you happy if you find someone who cares .

La-love, la-love .
Love can make you happy. .
Love can make you happy. .
Love can make you happy. .
