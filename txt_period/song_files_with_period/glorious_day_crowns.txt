one day when heaven was filled with his praises.
one day when sin was as black as could be.
jesus came forth to be born of a virgin.
dwelt among men, my example is he.
word became flesh and the light shined among us.
his glory revealed.
living, he loved me.
dying, he saved me.
buried, he carried my sins far away.
rising, he justified freely forever.
one day he's coming.
oh glorious day, oh glorious day.
one day they led him up calvary's mountain.
one day they nailed him to die on a tree.
suffering anguish, despised and rejected.
bearing our sins, my redeemer is he.
hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree.
and took the nails for me.
living, he loved me.
dying, he saved me.
buried, he carried my sins far away.
rising, he justified freely forever.
one day he's coming.
oh glorious day, oh glorious day.
one day the grave could conceal him no longer.
one day the stone rolled away from the door.
then he arose, over death he had conquered.
now is ascended, my lord evermore.
death could not hold him, the grave could not keep him.
from rising again.
living, he loved me.
dying, he saved me.
buried, he carried my sins far away.
rising, he justified freely forever.
one day he's coming.
oh glorious day, oh glorious day.
one day the trumpet will sound for his coming.
one day the skies with his glories will shine.
wonderful day, my beloved one bringing.
my savior jesus is mine.
living, he loved me.
dying, he saved me.
buried, he carried my sins far away.
rising, he justified freely forever.
one day he's coming.
oh glorious day, oh glorious day.
