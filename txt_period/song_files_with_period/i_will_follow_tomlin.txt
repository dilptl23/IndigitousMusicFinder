where you go, i'll go.
where you stay, i'll stay.
when you move, i'll move.
i will follow.
all your ways are good.
all your ways are sure.
i will trust in you alone.
higher than my side.
high above my life.
i will trust in you alone.
where you go, i'll go.
where you stay, i'll stay.
when you move, i'll move.
i will follow you.
who you love, i'll love.
how you serve i'll serve.
if this life i lose, i will follow you.
i will follow you.
light unto the world.
light unto my life.
i will live for you alone.
you're the one i seek.
knowing i will find.
all i need in you alone, in you alone.
