my foes are many, they rise against me.
but i will hold my ground.
i will not fear the war, i will not fear the storm.
my help is on the way, my help is on the way.

my refuge and strength always.
i will not fear, his promise is true.
my god will come through always, always.
troubles surround me, chaos abounding.

i will not fear the war, i will not fear the storm.
my help is on the way, my help is on the way.
oh, my god, he will not delay.
my refuge and strength always.

my god will come through always, always.
i lift my eyes up, my help comes from the lord.
i lift my eyes up, my help comes from the lord.
i lift my eyes up, my help comes from the lord.

from you lord, from you lord.
oh, my god, he will not delay.
my refuge and strength always.
i will not fear, his promise is true.
