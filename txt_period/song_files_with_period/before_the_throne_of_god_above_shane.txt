before the throne of god above.
i have a strong, a perfect plea.
a great high priest whose name is love.
who ever lives and pleads for me.
my name is graven on his hands.
my name is written on his heart.
i know that while in heaven he stands.
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
when satan tempts me to despair.
and tells me of the guilt within.
upward i look and see him there.
who made an end to all my sin.
because the sinless savior died.
my sinful soul is counted free.
for god the just is satisfied.
to look on him and pardon me.
to look on him and pardon me.
behold him there the risen lamb.
my perfect spotless righteousness.
the great unchangeable i am.
the king of glory and of grace.
one with himself i cannot die.
my soul is purchased by his blood.
my life is hid with christ on high.
with christ my savior and my god!.
with christ my savior and my god!.
one with himself i cannot die.
my soul is purchased by his blood.
my life is hid with christ on high.
with christ my savior and my god!.
with christ my savior and my god!.
