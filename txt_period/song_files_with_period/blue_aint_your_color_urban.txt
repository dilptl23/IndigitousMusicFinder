Blue Ain't Your Color.
Keith Urban.
I can see you over there.
Staring at your drink.

All alone tonight.
And chances are.
You're sittin' here in this bar.
‘Cause he ain't gonna treat you right.

But I'm gonna say it anyway.
‘Cause you look like.
You haven't felt the fire.
Had a little fun.

Baby.
Blue looks good on the sky.
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall.
But darling, it don't match your eyes.

You don't need that guy.
It's so black and white.
He's stealin' your thunder.
Baby, blue ain't your color.

Be another just.
Pick you up.
Kinda guy.
Tryna drink you up.

But I just don't understand.
How another man.
Can take your sun.
And turn it ice cold.

And it's makin'.
Me think that I just might.
Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn't change ya.
I'd just paint you bright.

Blue looks good on the sky.
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall.
But darling, it don't match your eyes.
I'm tellin' you.

It's so black and white.
He's stealin' your thunder.
Baby, blue ain't your color.
Blue looks good on the sky.

But darling, it don't match your eyes.
I'm tellin' you.
You don't need that guy.
It's so black and white.
