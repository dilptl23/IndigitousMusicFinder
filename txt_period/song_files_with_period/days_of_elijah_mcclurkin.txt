these are the days of elijah.
declaring the word of the lord, yeah.
and these are the days of your servant, moses.
righteousness being restored.
these are the days of great trials.
of famine and darkness and sword.
still we are the voice in the desert crying.
prepare ye the way of the lord!.
say, behold he comes, riding on the clouds.
shining like the sun, at the trumpet's call.
lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee.
out of zion's hill, salvation comes.
and these are the days of ezekiel.
the dry bones becoming as flesh.
and these are the days of your servant, david.
rebuilding the temple of praise.
and these are the days of the harvest.
the fields are all white in the world.
and we are the laborers that are in your vineyard.
declaring the word of the lord.
behold he comes, riding on the clouds.
shining like the sun at the trumpet's call.
lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee.
out of zion's hill, salvation comes.
there's no god like jehovah!.
there's no god like jehovah!.
there's no god like jehovah!.
there's no god like jehovah!.
behold he comes, riding on the clouds.
shining like the sun, at the trumpet's call.
lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee.
out of zion's hill, salvation comes.
