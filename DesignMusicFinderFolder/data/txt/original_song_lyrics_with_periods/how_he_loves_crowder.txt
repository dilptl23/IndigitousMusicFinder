he is jealous for me,.
loves like a hurricane, i am a tree,.
bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy..
when all of a sudden,.

and i realize just how beautiful you are,.
and how great your affections are for me..
and, oh, how he loves us, oh,.
oh, how he loves us,.

drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes,.
if his grace is an ocean, we're all sinking..
and heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,.
and my heart turns violently inside of my chest,.

when i think about the way....
that he loves us,.
oh, how he loves us,.
oh, how he loves us,.

yeah, he loves us,.
