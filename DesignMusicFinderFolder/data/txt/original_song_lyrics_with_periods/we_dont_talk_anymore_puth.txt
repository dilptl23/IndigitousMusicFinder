We Don't Talk Anymore.
Charlie Puth.
We don't talk anymore.
We don't talk anymore.

Like we used to do.
We don't love anymore.
What was all of it for?.
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do....

You've been looking for.
I wish I would have known that wasn't me.
Cause even after all this time.
I still wonder.

Just the way you did so easily.
Don't wanna know.
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight.
If he's holdin' onto you so tight.

I overdosed.
Should've known your love was a game.
Now I can't get you out of my brain.
Oh, it's such a shame.

We don't talk anymore.
We don't talk anymore.
Like we used to do.
We don't love anymore.

Oh, we don't talk anymore.
Like we used to do.
I just hope you're lying next to somebody.
Who knows how to love you like me.

Every now and then I think you might want me to.
Come show up at your door.
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong.
Don't wanna know.

If she's holdin' onto you so tight the way I did before.
I overdosed.
Should've known your love was a game.
Now I can't get you out of my brain.

Like we used to do.
We don't love anymore.
(we don't we don't).

(we don't we don't).
Oh, we don't talk anymore.
Like we used to do.
Like we used to do.

Kind of dress you're wearing tonight.
If he's giving it to you just right.
The way I did before.
I overdosed.

Now I can't get you out of my brain.
Oh, it's such a shame.
That we don't talk anymore.
(we don't we don't).

(we don't we don't).
We don't talk anymore.
Like we used to do.
We don't love anymore.

What was all of it for?.
(we don't we don't).
Oh, we don't talk anymore.
Like we used to do.

Don't wanna know.
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight (oh).
If he's holding onto you so tight (oh).
The way I did before.

I overdosed.
Should've known your love was a game (oh).
Now I can't get you out of my brain (whoa).
Oh, it's such a shame.
