i'm trading my sorrow.
i'm trading my shame.
i'm laying them down for the joy of the lord.
i'm trading my sickness.

i'm laying them down for the joy of the lord.
and we say yes lord yes lord yes yes lord.
yes lord yes lord yes yes lord.
yes lord yes lord yes yes lord amen.

struck down but not destroyed.
i'm blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure.
and his joy's gonna be my strength.
though the sorrow may last for the night.
