the greatest day in history.
death is beaten, you have rescued me.
sing it out, jesus is alive.
the empty cross, the empty grave.

shout it out, jesus is alive.
he's alive.
oh, happy day, happy day.
you washed my sin away.

i'll never be the same.
forever i am changed.
when i stand in that place.
free at last, meeting face to face.

endless joy, perfect peace.
earthly pain finally will cease.
celebrate, jesus is alive.
he's alive.

you washed my sin away.
oh, happy day, happy day.
i'll never be the same.
oh no, forever i am changed.

what a glorious way.
that you have saved me.
and oh, what a glorious day.
what a glorious name.

you washed my sin away.
oh, happy day, happy day.
i'll never be the same.
oh no, forever i am changed.
