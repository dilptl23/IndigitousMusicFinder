with this heart open wide.
from the depths from the heights.
i will bring a sacrifice.
with these hands lifted high.

i will bring a sacrifice.
i will bring a sacrifice.
i lay me down.
i'm not my own.

lay me down.
lay me down.
oh, hand on my heart.
this much is true.

lay me down.
lay me down.
letting go of my pride.
giving up all my rights.

take this life and let it shine.
i lay me down.
i'm not my own.
i belong to you alone.

lay me down, oh oh oh.
hand on my heart.
this much is true.
there's no life apart from you.

lay me down.
oh oh oh.
lay me down.
lay me down.

your will, your way.
it will be my joy to say.
your will, your way.
it will be my joy to say.

it will be my joy to say.
your will, your way.
it will be my joy to say.
your will, your way.

your will, your way, always.
i lay me down.
i'm not my own.
i belong to you alone.

lay me down, oh oh oh.
hand on my heart.
this much is true.
there's no life apart from you.

lay me down, oh oh oh.
lay me down.
lay me down, oh oh oh.
lay me down.
