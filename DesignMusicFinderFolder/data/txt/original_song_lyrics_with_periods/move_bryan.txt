Move
Luke Bryan

Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Backed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much

A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern bells
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell

Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week to

All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips

When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice

But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me

All up in the middle of your left and right
Your side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week to

All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips

When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice

But I can't move when you move

Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love the way you, love the way you feel the beat
C-O-M-E


Move like you do
Sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Girl, just look at you

Live oak, moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky

DJ playin' throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
