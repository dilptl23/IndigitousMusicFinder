i want to be close, close to your side.
so heaven is real and death is a lie.
i want to hear voices of angels above.
singing as one.

god almighty, the great i am.
who is worthy, none beside thee.
god almighty, the great i am.
i want to be near, near to your heart.

i want to see dry bones living again.
singing as one.
hallelujah, holy, holy.
god almighty, the great i am.

god almighty, the great i am.
the great i am.
the mountains shake before you the demons run and flee.
at the mention of the name king of majesty.

or any who can stand.
before the power and the presence of the great i am.
the great i am the great i am yeah.
hallelujah, holy, holy.

who is worthy, none beside thee.
god almighty, the great i am.
hallelujah, holy, holy.
god almighty, the great i am.
