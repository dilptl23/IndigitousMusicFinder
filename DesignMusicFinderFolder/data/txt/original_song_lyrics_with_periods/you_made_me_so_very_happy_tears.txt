You Made Me So Very Happy.
Blood, Sweat, and Tears.
I lost at love before .
Got mad and closed the door .

I chose you for the one .
Now we're havin' so much fun .
You treated me so kind .
I'm about to lose my mind .

I'm so glad you .
Came into my life .
The others were untrue .
But when it came to lovin' you .

'Cause you came and you took control .
You touch my very soul .
You always show me that .
Lovin' you is where it's at .

I'm so glad you .
Came into my life .
Thank you, baby.
I love you so much you see.

I can hear.
Baby, I can hear you calling me.
I'm so in love with you .
All I ever want to do is .

You made me so very happy .
I'm so glad you.
Came into my life .
You made me so very happy .

I'm so glad you.
Came into my life.
Mmmm, I want to thank you, girl.
Every day of my life.
