In the Name of Love.
Martin Garrix.
If I told you this was only gonna hurt.
If I warned you that the fire's gonna burn.

Do it all in the name of love.
Would you let me lead you even when you're blind?.
In the darkness, in the middle of the night.
In the silence, when there's no one by your side.

In the name of love, name of love.
In the name of love, name of love.
In the name of love.
In the name, name.

In the name, name.
In the name of.
In the name, name.
In the name of.

If I told you we could bathe in all the lights.
Would you rise up, come and meet me in the sky?.
Would you trust me when you're jumping from the heights?.
Would you fall in the name of love?.

When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed.
I will hold you in the depths of your despair.
And it's all in the name of love.
In the name of love, name of love.

In the name of love.
In the name, name.
In the name of.
In the name, name.

In the name, name.
In the name of.
Love.
I wanna testify.

You bring me back to life.
And it's all in the name of love.
I wanna testify.
Scream in the holy light.

And it's all in the name of love.
In the name of love, name of love.
In the name of love, name of love.
In the name of love.

In the name of.
In the name, name.
In the name of.
In the name, name.
