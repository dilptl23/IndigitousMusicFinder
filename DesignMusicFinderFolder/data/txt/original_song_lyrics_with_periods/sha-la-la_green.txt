Sha-la-la.
Al Green.
Sha la la la-- la la la.
Oh baby.

Oh baby.
I've been gone so long I know what to do.
Oh baby.
That I know you don't know what I've been going through.

'Cause you make me happy baby, so I can say.
Sha la la la-- la la la.
I love you.
Sha la la la-- la la la.

I know you can tell what's on my mind.
Oh baby.
And I've been feeling this way for such a long time.
Ya, baby.

I'm trying, this feeling just won't die.
Oh.
Sha la la la-- la la la.
Make you cry.

Baby.
And once I see you I can't leave your love alone.
Ya, heh, baby.
Aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy baby, let me sing.
