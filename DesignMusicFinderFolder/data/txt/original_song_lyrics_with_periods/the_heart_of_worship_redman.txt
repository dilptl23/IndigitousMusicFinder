when the music fades.
all is stripped away.
and i simply come.
longin' just to bring.

that will bless your heart.
i'll bring you more than a song.
for a song in itself.
is not what you have required.

through the ways things appear.
you're looking into my heart.
i'm comin' back to the heart of worship.
and it's all about you.

i'm sorry lord for the thing i've made it.
when it's all about you.
it's all about you, jesus.
the king of endless worth.

how much you deserve? lord.
though i'm weak and poor.
all i have is yours.
every single breath.

for a song in itself.
is not what you have required.
you search much deeper.
you search much deeper within.

you're looking into my heart.
i'm comin' back to the heart of worship.
and it's all about you.
it's all about you, jesus.

when it's all about you.
it's all about you, jesus.
i'm comin' back to the heart of worship.
and it's all about you.

i'm sorry lord for the thing i've made it.
when it's all about you.
it's all about you, jesus, yeah.
it's all about you.

every breath we breathe, jesus.
its all about you.
it's all about you, lord.
i'm comin' back to the heart of worship.

since it's all about you, jesus.
i'm sorry lord for the thing i've made it.
when it's all about you.
it's all about you, jesus.

every melody every heart beat.
every breath we breathe.
it's all about you.
there's no one.

it's all about you.
it's all about you.
yeah we know that.
you will not share your glory with another.

jesus, you will not share your glory with another.
oh, you shall not share your glory with another.
you will not share your glory with another, jesus.
oh, you shall not share your glory with another.
