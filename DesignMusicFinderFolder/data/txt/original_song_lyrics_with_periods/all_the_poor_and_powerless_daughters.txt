all the poor and powerless.
and all the lost and lonely.
all the thieves will come confess.
and know that you are holy.

and all will sing out.
hallelujah.
and we will cry out.
hallelujah.

and all who feel unworthy.
and all who hurt with nothing left.
will know that you are holy.
and all will sing out.

and we will cry out.
hallelujah.
shout it.
go on and scream it from the mountains.

that he is god.
we will sing out.
hallelujah.
and we will cry out.

we will sing out.
hallelujah.
shout it.
go on and scream it from the mountains.
