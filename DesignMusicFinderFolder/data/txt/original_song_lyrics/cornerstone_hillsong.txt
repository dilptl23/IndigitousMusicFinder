my hope is built on nothing less
than jesus blood and righteousness
i dare not trust the sweetest frame
but wholly trust in jesus name
my hope is built on nothing less
than jesus blood and righteousness
i dare not trust the sweetest frame
but wholly trust in jesus name
christ alone; cornerstone
weak made strong; in the saviour's love
through the storm, he is lord
lord of all
when darkness seems to hide his face
i rest on his unchanging grace
in every high and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil
my anchor holds within the veil
christ alone; cornerstone
weak made strong; in the saviour's love
through the storm, he is lord
lord of all
he is lord
lord of all
christ alone; cornerstone
weak made strong; in the saviour's love
through the storm, he is lord
lord of all
christ alone; cornerstone
weak made strong; in the saviour's love
through the storm, he is lord
lord of all
when he shall come with trumpet sound,
oh, may i then in him be found;
dressed in his righteousness alone,
faultless stand before the throne.
