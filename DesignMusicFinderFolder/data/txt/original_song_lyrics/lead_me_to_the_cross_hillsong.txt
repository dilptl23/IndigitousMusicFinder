savior i come
quiet my soul remember
redemption's hill
where your blood was spilled
for my ransom
everything i once held dear
i count it all as loss
lead me to the cross
where your love poured out
bring me to my knees
lord i lay me down
rid me of myself
i belong to you
lead me, lead me to the cross
you were as i
tempted and trialed
human
the word became flesh
bore my sin and death
now you're risen
everything i once held dear
i count it all as loss
to your heart
to your heart
lead me to your heart
lead me to your heart
