wonderful, so wonderful
is your unfailing love
your cross has spoken mercy over me
no eye has seen no ear has heard
no heart could fully know
how glorious, how beautiful you are.
beautiful one i love you
beautiful one i adore
beautiful one my soul must sing.
powerful so powerful
your glory fills the skies
your mighty works displayed for all to see
the beauty of your majesty
awakes my heart to see
how marvelous how wonderful you are.
beautiful one i love you
beautiful one i adore
beautiful one my soul must sing.
beautiful one i love you
beautiful one i adore
beautiful one my soul must sing.
you opened my eyes to your wonders anew
you captured my heart with this love
because nothing on earth is as beautiful as you
you opened my eyes to your wonders anew
you captured my heart with this love
because nothing on earth is as beautiful as you are.
beautiful one i love you
beautiful one i adore
beautiful one my soul must sing.
beautiful one i love you
beautiful one i adore
beautiful one my soul must sing.
and you opened my eyes to your wonders anew
you captured my heart with this love
because nothing on earth is as beautiful as you are.
